Dear Helen Maxwell,
Thank you for giving as the opportunity of having our party on that fantastic place.
We had a very good time there and we are so grateful because of your welcoming.
The party had so good sound and music, I believe that can be because of the high tech speakers that the Sports Centre has.
Also the place was big enough for all the people we went, and that is not esy to found.
The amount of grate things the Sport Centre has is quite a big one, but we also founded some imperfections on the service.
On one hand the food was excellent in terms of quality, but on the other hand there was not enough for everyone.
I can say nothing obout the quantity of all the different drinks, but again, we drank fast and we finished all the drinks so early.
Maybe for the next party you can increase the amount of food and drinks.
Regards,
Jordi Blasco
