## Graph Neural Networks
### Why GNNs?
Let us start by defining our multi-dimensional vectors $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\text{Train}$ and $\text{Test}$. Then, in our **usual** vectorial setting, the aim of a Neural Network, say a Multi-Layer perceptron (MLP) is to learn a **latent space** where the projections $\mathbf{h}\in\mathbb{R}^{d'}$ (with $d'\ll d$) of the inputs $\mathbf{x}$ do minimize a given loss function, such as the cross entropy wrt $\text{Train}$. This is usually expressed as follows 

$$
\mathbf{h} = \text{MLP}_{\Theta}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{Test}})\;,\text{where}\;\; \Theta =\arg\min_{\Omega} \text{CE}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{Train}})\;,
$$

where $\Omega$ is the parameter space where the unknowns $\Theta$ of the learner do "live". 

By virtue of functional composition, a MLP is just the staking of many non-linear functions called **layers** $\text{L}^{l}$, with $l\ge 1$. Using recursion, we have

$$
\text{L}^{(l)}=
\begin{cases}
     \sigma^{(l)}(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(l)}) &\;\text{if}\;  l> 1 \\[2ex]
     \sigma^{(1)}(\mathbf{W}^{(1)}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}^{(1)})
     &\;\text{otherwise}\\[2ex]
\end{cases}
$$

The above definition is *ambiguous on purpose*. Why? 

- Firstly, the **embedding** $\mathbf{h}^{(l)}$ resulting from **the function** $\text{L}^{(l)}$ is given by the composition 

$$
\mathbf{h}^{(l)}=\text{L}^{(l)}\circ \text{L}^{(l-1)}\;.
$$

- However, instead of using a functional notation for $\text{L}^{(l-1)}$, we use the resulting embedding $\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)}$ of that layer. Note that the base case of the recursion is $\mathbf{h}^{(0)}=\mathbf{x}$, which corresponds to $\text{L}^{(1)}$.

Therefore, if the MLP has $L$ layers, we can consider it as the following function: 

$$
\text{MLP}(\mathbf{x})=\text{L}^{(L-1)}\circ \text{L}^{(L-2)}\circ\ldots\circ \text{L}^{(1)}\;.
$$

In terms of results, $\mathbf{h}=\mathbf{h}^{(L)}$ results the following processing chain: 

$$
\mathbf{h}\xleftarrow{\Theta^{(L)}} \mathbf{h}^{(L-1)}\xleftarrow{\Theta^{(L-1)}}\mathbf{h}^{(L-2)}\xleftarrow{\Theta^{(L-2)}} \ldots\xleftarrow{\Theta^{(1)}}\mathbf{h}^{(0)}\;.
$$

where $\Theta^{(l)}=(\mathbf{W}^{(l)},\mathbf{h}^{(l)},\sigma^{(l)})$ are the parameters (weights, biases and non-linear activations) characterizing each layer. Actually,

$$
\Omega = \Theta^{(L)}\times \Theta^{(L-1)}\times\ldots\times \Theta^{(1)}
$$

is usually a huge (parameter) space! 

**Learning as search**. As a result, learning via MLPs (or NNs in general) can be seen as findind the parameters $\Theta\in\Omega$ of a *composed function* $\text{MLP}_{\Theta}$ that best maps inputs $\mathbf{x}$ to outputs $\mathbf{h}$. 

#### Context is everything
Evolved NNs such as the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index), the state-of-the-art core of LLMs and other AI agents, do leverage the concept of **context**. In short, inputs $\mathbf{x}$ do not appear isolated but in **streams** (this is valid for words in texts as well as for patches in images).

Therefore, when an input $\mathbf{x}_k$ is seen as a part of a stream 

$$
\ldots\;\underbrace{\mathbf{x}_{k-\frac{h}{2}}\;\mathbf\;{x}_{k-\frac{h}{2}+1}\;\ldots\;\mathbf{x}_{k-1}}_{\text{left context}}\mathbf{x}_k\;\underbrace{\mathbf{x}_{k+1}\;\ldots\;\mathbf{x}_{k+h-1}\mathbf{x}_{k+\frac{h}{2}}}_{\text{right context}}\;\ldots
$$

its **context** is given by the previous (left context) and the subsequent (right context) inputs in the stream. In general, this context is *finite up to the memory resources* and its size is given by $h$. For instance, for $h=4$ we should have

$$
\ldots\;\underbrace{\mathbf{x}_{k-2}\;\mathbf\;{x}_{k-1}}_{\text{left context}}\mathbf{x}_k\;\underbrace{\mathbf{x}_{k+1}\;\mathbf{x}_{k+2}}_{\text{right context}}\;\ldots
$$

##### How do we consider context during training?
 In Transformers, the driving mechanism is [Self Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Let us break it up via an example. 


Consider for instance the following input stream: 

$$
\mathbf{H} = 
\underbrace{\text{"The}}_{\mathbf{h}_1}\;
\underbrace{\text{animal}}_{\mathbf{h}_2}\;  
\underbrace{\text{didn't}}_{\mathbf{h}_3}\;
\underbrace{\text{cross}}_{\mathbf{h}_4}\;
\underbrace{\text{the}}_{\mathbf{h}_5}\;    
\underbrace{\text{street}}_{\mathbf{h}_6}\; 
\underbrace{\text{because}}_{\mathbf{h}_7}\; 
\underbrace{\textbf{it}}_{\mathbf{h}_8}\;  
\underbrace{\text{was}}_{\mathbf{h}_9}\; 
\underbrace{\text{too}}_{\mathbf{h}_{10}}\; 
\underbrace{\text{tired."}}_{\mathbf{h}_{N=11}}\;      
$$

This input stream is considered a $N\times d_{model}$ **matrix** $\mathbf{H}$ where each row is the **numerical embedding** of a term/word $\mathbf{h}_1,\mathbf{h}_2,\ldots,$ each one *encoding* numerically the basic semantics of each word ("The", "animal", etc). All the embeddings do have dimension $d_{model}$. 

All the embeddings are learnable and the may play three different roles: 

- **Query (Q)**: The Query vector for a word determines what information it is looking for from other words in the sequence. It's the "selector" or "questioner."

- **Key (K)**: The Key vector for a word determines how relevant it is to other words' queries. It's what the Query vectors are compared against.

- **Value (V)**: The Value vector for a word contains the information that will be passed on to other words, weighted by their attention scores. It's the actual content being communicated.

By creating these separate vectors, the self-attention mechanism can learn to **capture different aspects of the word's meaning and its relationship to other words**. The interaction between Queries and Keys determines the attention weights, which in turn dictate how much of each Value vector contributes to the final output representation of a word. This allows the model to dynamically weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when processing a specific word.

Keys, queries and values are taken from *dictionaries*. For instance, we query a dictionary "it" and when the query matches a key entry in the dictionary, we retrieve a value (description). 

Then, given an initial embedding, say $\mathbf{h}_{\omega}$, say $\omega=\text{"it"}$, we obtain its "flavor" as Key, Query and Value by linear projection: 

$$
\mathbf{K}_{\omega}=\mathbf{W}_K\mathbf{h}_{\omega},\;\;
\mathbf{Q}_{\omega}=\mathbf{W}_Q\mathbf{h}_{\omega},\;\;\text{and}\;\;
\mathbf{V}_{\omega}=\mathbf{W}_V\mathbf{h}_{\omega}\;.
$$

where $\mathbf{W}_K$, $\mathbf{W}_Q$ and $\mathbf{W}_V$ are **learnable matrices** of respective size $d_{model}\times d_k$, $d_{model}\times d_q$ and $d_{model}\times d_v$. Actually, these matrices work as separated MLPs. 

**NOTE**: since *Keys and Queries should ideally match*, it is usually assumed that $d_k=d_q$. However, $d_v$ can be different from $d_k$ and $d_q$. This is done, for instance, to accomodate a richer semantics as it happens in real dictionaries. It is also typical to make $d_v$ smaller for efficiency reasons.
<br></br>
<span style="color:#2f6004">
**How do we know that "it" refers to "animal" in this case?**. 
</span>
<br></br>
Well, the basic mechanism to built the Transformer's result wrt a given query (say "it") is as follows: 

**Unormalized**. Given the Query $\mathbf{Q}_{\omega=\text{"it"}}$, we should acount for the level of correlation between it and each of the Keys. In maths, the correlation between two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is usually done via the dot product $\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\rangle := \mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^T$ (projection of the first on the second): 

$$
\mathbf{Q}_{\omega=\text{"it"}}\mathbf{K}^T_{\omega'}\;\;\text{with}\;\;\omega'\in \{\text{"The"},\text{"animal"},\ldots,\text{"tired."}\}\;.
$$

Each of the above products *results in a scalar value*, say $S_{(\omega=\text{"it"},\omega')}$. Then, from the viewpoint of the "it" Query, we have a sequence of correlations: 

$$
S_{(\omega=\text{"it"},\omega'=\text{"The"})}\;,
S_{(\omega=\text{"it"},\omega'=\text{"animal"})}\;,\ldots,\;
S_{(\omega=\text{"it"},\omega'=\text{"tired."})}\;.
$$

Since each of these values can be either positive or negative, we transform the above sequence into a [probability distribution](https://medium.com/@touhid3.1416/the-surprisingly-simple-math-behind-transformer-attention-mechanism-d354fbb4fef6) by means of the softmax function. 

Remind that $\text{Softmax}(\mathbf{x}_i):=\mathbf{\exp(\mathbf{x}_i)/\sum_{i'} \exp(\mathbf{x}_{i'})}$ operates on a vector/sequence $\mathbf{x}$ and the result is highly biased towards the maximal values of $\mathbf{x}$, where it assigns a $1$, and the smallest ones, where it assigns a $0$. The authors of [Attention is all You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) pointed out that, when the dot product is large in magnitude, the softmax is pushed to regions where gradient is small, thus difficulting learning. This is why the dot products are scaled by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$. 

In short, softmaxing each row and stacking the rows leads to create the following $N\times N$ matrix: 

$$
\mathbf{S}:=\text{Softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\;,
$$

where $\sum_{\omega'} S_{\omega,\omega'}=1\;\forall\omega$ (each row adds up to $1$). 

**The values**. In parallel to the computation of the softmax coefficients, we have yet projected the *actual semantics* of each term, which is contained in the  **values** $\mathbf{V}_{\omega'}$ of the respective terms.

Then, the new values embedding (say for $\mathbf{V}_{\omega}$) results from the weighted sum 

$$
\mathbf{h}_{\omega} := \sum_{\omega'}S_{(\omega,\omega')}\mathbf{V}_{\omega'}\;.
$$

Then, $\mathbf{h}_{\omega}$ is a simple way of expressing the **contextual semantics** of $\mathbf{V}_{\omega}$. If $\omega=\text{"it"}$, then $\mathbf{h}_{\omega}$ will combine all the values proportionally to how "it" **attends** (or matches) each of the Keys. 

More compactly, the notation
 
$$
\text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{K},\mathbf{V}) :=
\text{Softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\mathbf{V}\;,
$$

returns an attention matrix. 

This process is summarized in {numref}`Attention`.

```

**On the learning of the input Keys, Querys and Values**. Herein, it is important to note that the embedding for the word "animal", for instance, is *unique* and learnable. This is why we project this embedding on $\mathbf{W}_K$, $\mathbf{W}_Q$ and $\mathbf{W}_V$ to get the "flavor" of the "same word" as Key, Query or Value, when required. 

##### Transformers as graphs 

Looking at $\mathbf{S}:=\text{Softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{K}\mathbf{Q}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)$ we can see $\mathbf{S}$ as an *attributed graph* where $\mathbf{S}\in\mathbb{R}^{M\times M}$ is an *attributed adjacency matrix* and $\mathbf{S}_{(\omega,\omega')}\in [0,1]$ is the corresponding attention weight of $\mathbf{Q}_{\omega}$ wrt to $\mathbf{K}_{\omega'}$. 

Take now a global look to $\mathbf{S}$ (see {numref}`AttentionGE`): 

```{figure} ./images/Topic1/AttentionGraphE.png
---
name: AttentionGE
width: 800px
align: center
height: 250px
---
Attention as an attributed graph. Image partially generated by Gemini. 
```
Note that nodes have **self-loops** corresponding to self-attentions (diagonal elements $\mathbf{S}_{(\omega,\omega)}$) because they appear to be relevant as themselves. However, not all of them are equally relevant. 

In particular, the word "animal" attends mostly itself, whereas "it" attends also "animal" (obviously) and "tired" (because it is a property of the animal). The remaining terms have very low self-attentions (below $0.01$ they do not appear in the Figure).

**NOTE**: This graph changes dynamically, as well as the embbedings and the weights of the Query, Key and Value matrices. 

**Update as Message Passing**. Finally, the update 

$$
\mathbf{h}_{\omega} := \sum_{\omega'}S_{(\omega,\omega')}\mathbf{V}_{\omega'}\;.
$$

can be seen as if all nodes $\omega'$ in the graph send a message $\mathbf{V}_{\omega'}$ to node $\omega$, where this message is modulated by $S_{(\omega,\omega')}$. As a result, the node $\omega$ updates its state!

In {numref}`AttentionGE`, $\mathbf{h}_{\omega=\text{"it"}}$ is mainly updated by the current value of "animal" as well as by the existing value of "it" (self-attention). 

##### Masking and sequentiality 

Despite the above visualization of the attention graph is explanatory, *it is not used during the actual forward pass or training of a Transformer model*.

**Attention Masking** (see optional mask in {numref}`Attention`) is used to prevent certain terms/tokens from attending to other tokens. The most common type of masking relevant to sequential processing is **look-ahead masking** (also known as causal masking), which is typically used in the decoder of a Transformer. In look-ahead masking, the attention scores for future tokens are set to a very low value (effectively zero after softmax) so that a token can only attend to tokens that come before it in the sequence. *This is essential for tasks like language generation where the model should not have access to future information*.

We have rebuilt this graph to attend only past tokens in {numref}`AttentionSeq`.

---
name: AttentionSeq

---
Sequential attention. Image partially generated by Gemini. 
```

Now, self-attention increases (attend the present, as well as past, but not future). In other words, $\mathbf{S}$ is zero above the diagonal!I.e.: 

$$
\mathbf{h}_{\omega} := \sum_{\omega'\le\omega}S_{(\omega,\omega')}\mathbf{V}_{\omega'}\;.
$$


Since these **decoder-enforcing** Transformers use the past and present to predict (generate) the future, they are usually called **next token machines**.

This is the usual setting for LLMs (Language-based Transformers) and it **limits the expresiveness** of the Transformer (as we will see later). However, in Vision Language Models or VLMs (Vision Transformers or ViT), free attention is applied. Therein, tokes are "sequentialized" image patches and it is logical that a patch can attend any other patch. 

### The power of aggregation
**Message Passing** is implicit in certain types of Transformers. This is one of the ingredients that make Transformers so powerful. 

As we have seen, Message Passing (MP) provides a flexible combination of the ouput of three MLPs (Queries, Keys and Values) running in parallel for the same inputs. 

However, Transformers usually **process sequences** (NLP) or transform objects (ViT) into sequences to further processing. But **What if the objects to process are not sequences, but graphs or networks?** 

This latter point is important, since **graphs are not ordered structures**. Indeed, <span style="color:#2f6004">the expressive power of graph relies on the fact they are **invariant to any order**</span>.

#### Point Clouds and Invariance 
In addition to Transformers, which can be seen as graphs (attention graphs), there is a problem where <span style="color:#2f6004">**permutation invariance**</span> becomes key: this problem is **Point-cloud recognition and segmentation** (see {numref}`PointCloud`). In the following, we see how traditional MLP architectures must introduce invariant operators to solve it, and this leads to a natural graph-based formulation.

##### Permutation Invariance
An MLP does implement permutation invariance if this happens: 

$$
\text{MLP}_{\Theta}({\cal S}) = \text{MLP}_{\Theta}(\Pi({\cal S}))\;,
$$

where ${\cal S}=\{\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_N\}$ is a set of $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (where $d=3$ in 3D point clouds) and $\Pi:\{1,2,\ldots N\}\rightarrow \{1,2,\ldots N\}$ is a function that permutes the order in the points in ${\cal S}$:

$$
\Pi({\cal S})=\{\mathbf{x}_{\Pi(1)},\mathbf{x}_{\Pi(2)},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{\Pi(N)}\}\;.
$$

For instance, in $\Pi(\{1,2,3,\ldots N\})=\{2,1,3,\ldots N\}$, $\Pi$ just permutes the first two elements. 

Obviously, there are $N!$ possible permutations and the MLP has to give the same output. In other words, if the set ${\cal S_{plane}}$ must be classified as a plane, then $\Pi({\cal S_{plane}})$ must also be classifed as a plane by the same MLP.

The solution is depicted in {numref}`PointNet`. The PointNet NN is a ground breaking development. Apparently is yet another (huge MLP) but we have some observations:

```

1) **Input**. It is a tensor of $N\times 3$ (stack of $N$ 3D $(x,y,z)$ points). Note that if we have 3D models all of them are discretized to the same resolution ($N$ is a constant). In addition, tif two models correspond to the same category (say planes) they are **are not pre-aligned**, i.e. one is seen as a permutation of the other. 
2) **1st T-Net**. T-Net is a NN with two objectives: (1) Learn a common $3\times 3$ transformation (alignment) with all the training point clouds, and (2) apply it to the $N\times 3$ input. 
3) **1st MLP**. Transforms the $N\times 3$ output of the first T-Net into a $N\times 64$. This is basically necessary in order to add some context to the $(x,y,z)$ points: with $64$ overall dimensions it is possible to discriminate between corner points and surface points, etc. 
4) **2nd T-Net**. Scaled version of the 1st one, now with a point cloud of $N\times 64$. 
5) **2nd NLP**. Scaled version of the 1st MLP, now going from $64$ to $1024$ dimensions. 
6) **Max Pooling**. This is the <span style="color:#2f6004">**invariant part of PointNet**</span>. Given the tensor of size $N\times 1024$ whose rows correspond to extended features of the $(x,y,z)$ points, now collapse into a unique $1\times 1024$ tensor taking the $\max$ at each dimension. This simple operation makes that identical input tensors but corresponding to the "same permutation" result in a similar $1\times 1024$ hash. 
7) Once we have the global hash we can feed a **final MLP** of send it to feed the segmentation network with also a final MLP. 

The solution is depicted in {numref}`PointNet++`. The PointNet++ NN improves PointNet as follows:

```

1) **KNN graph**. The input to the NN is not a tensor but a graph where two points are linked if they are among the $K$ closer neighbors of each point. The nodes contain the $(x,y,z)$ features of the corresponding points. 

2) **Discrete Convolution**. This is the name of the neighborhood aggregation plus an MLP which allows to capture the local context of each point span <span style="color:#2f6004">**in a permutation-invariant way**</span>. 

3) **Downsampling**. Essentially a pooling. 

#### Graphs implement Discrete Convolutions 
Let $G = (V, E)$ denote a graph, where $V = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_N\}$ represents the set of $N$ nodes and $E \subseteq V \times V$ represents the set of edges. We use the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \{0, 1\}^{N \times N}$ to encode the graph structure, where $\mathbf{A}_{ij} = 1$ if there exists an edge between nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$, and $\mathbf{A}_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.

**Node features and labels**. Each node $v_i$ is associated with a feature vector $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the feature space. These features are collectively represented as a matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$, where the $i$-th row corresponds to the feature vector of node $v_i$. For **supervised node classification**, a subset of nodes $V_L \subset V$ have associated labels $y_i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, C\}$, where $C$ is the number of classes.

**Example**. In {numref}`GraphInit`, we show a graph with nodes 

$$V=\{A,B,C,D,E\}$$
and edges 

$$
E=\{(A,B),(A,C),(B,C),(C,D),(C,E),(D,E)\}\;.
$$ 

In this case, the graph is *undirected* which means that if $(i,j)\in E$ then $(j,i)\in E$ and we do not need to denote both edges.

---
name: GraphInit

height: 500px
---
Initial graph with features. Image partially generated by Gemini. 
```

**Features and labels**. Note the we show the features $\mathbf{x}_i$ of each node $i$ and their *ground-truth labels* $y_i$. In this example, we have $d=2$ features per node and $C=2$ classes.  

Looking at the features, we have that nodes $A$ and $B$ are consistently associated with class $0$: in this class $\mathbf{x}_i(1)> \mathbf{x}_i(2)$ and $\mathbf{x}_i(2)\ge 0.5$. Similarly, nodes $C$ and $D$ are consistently associated with class $1$: $\mathbf{x}_i(1)> \mathbf{x}_i(2)$ and $\mathbf{x}_i(1)\ge 0.5$. However, the features of node $C$ place it in between both classes. 

Independently of the training-test split (which is irrelevant to this example) <span style="color:#2f6004">**a linear separation will be hard in this case**</span>, because of node $C$. Thus, for a simple MLP we will obtain something close to the decision in {numref}`MLPInit`

**Graphs provide local context**. The reason of the above lack of performance quite obvious: MLPs deal with node features **independently**. However, since <span style="color:#2f6004">**graphs implement pairwise relations between variables**</span>, it is expected that neighboring nodes do have similar properties, in particular their labels. When neighboring tend to share the same label, this is know as **homophily**. 

By **ignoring graph edges** and the context provided by the neighborhood, an MLP fails to capture the relational patterns that are often indicative of a node's class in graph-structured data.

**Invariant aggregation**. Suppose now, that for any node $\mathbf{v}_i$, we *aggregate the features of its neighbors* and pass the aggretation, instead of passing directly its features to the MLP. In other words, all we do is to  feed the MLP with a *new embedding that accounts for the local context of each node. Such embedding, $\mathbf{h}_i$, is <span style="color:#2f6004">**aggregated in an invariant way wrt the order of the neighbors**</span>. This means that we can only use functions such as the SUM, MEAN and the MAX as aggregators: 

$$
\mathbf{h}_i := \sum_{j\in \mathcal{N}(i)\cup \{i\}}\mathbf{x}_j,\;\; \mathbf{h}_i :=\frac{1}{|{\cal N}(i)|}\sum_{j\in \mathcal{N}(i) \bigcup \{i\}}\mathbf{x}_j,\;\;\text{or}\;
\;\mathbf{h}_i :=\max_{j\in \mathcal{N}(i)\bigcup \{i\}}\mathbf{x}_j\;, 
$$

where $\mathcal{N}(i)$ denotes the *neighbors* of node $v_i$. Note that the features of $\mathbf{x}_i$ are included in the update, as if there was a self-loop for each node in the graph (as self-attention in Transformers).

Under invariant aggregation, the result $\mathbf{h}_i$ is the same independently of the order in wich the neighbors are processed. Thus, graphs do have a more flexible coding than sequences.

In {numref}`MLPAgg`, we see that the representations $\mathbf{h}_i$ of nodes $A/B$ and $C/D$ collapse in the same point, thus facilitating the MLP decision, and the representation of $C$ is *attracted* to the area of $A$ and $B$:

### GNNs basic architecture
In short, given an input graph $G=(V,E)$ (which may change via [rewiring](https://ellisalicante.org/tutorials/GraphRewiring)), each of the $L$ layers of a GNN has three components: 

1) **Message passing**. Each node sends its interal state (its current embedding) to its neighbors (possibily including itsef).

2) **Aggregation**. Each node receives a message from its adjacend neighbors. This message is usually weighted by a **confidence coefficient**. Then, all messages are aggregated using an order invariant operator (SUM, MEAN, MAX).

3) **Update**. The new internal state is built both on the aggregation and its *projection* via an MLP. 

All these steps are summarized in {numref}`GNNArchitecture` where we highlight the last MLP layer for classification/regression:

GNN architecture (for the example graph). Image partially generated by Gemini. 
```

In a more formal way, we have:  

$$
\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} := \text{UPDATE}^{(l)} \left( \mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}, \text{AGGREGATE}^{(l)} \left( \{ \text{MESSAGE}^{(l)}(\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}, \mathbf{h}_j^{(l)}, \mathbf{e}_{ij}) : j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\cup \{i\} \} \right) \right)
$$

which is basically coincident (for the SUM) with 

$$
\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} :=\sigma^{(l)}\left(\mathbf{W}^{(l)} \left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\cup \{i\}}\alpha_{ij}\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}
\right)+ b^{(l)}\right) = \text{MLP}^{(l)}_{\Theta}\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\cup \{i\}}\alpha_{ij}\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}\right)\;,
$$

where $\alpha_{ij}$ are *learnable attention coefficients* (see below). In short, <span style="color:#2f6004">**a GNN layer is an MLP of the aggregation**</span>. 

In matricial form we have (droping the attention coefficients and biases for the sake of clarity): 

$$
\mathbf{H}^{(l+1)} := \sigma^{(l)}(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\tilde{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{H}^{(l)})\;,
$$

where $\tilde{\mathbf{A}}=\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I}$ is the adjacency matrix with self-loops (ones in the diagonal). Therefore $\mathbf{H}^{(l+1)}$ is an $N\times d^{(l+1)}$ matrix, where $d^{(l+1)}$ is the output dimension of the $l-$th MLP. Then, this matrix  encapsulates the *new* embedding of the nodes in its rows.

In addition, the expression $\tilde{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{H}^{(l)}$, where $\mathbf{H}^{(l)}$ is an $N\times d^{(l)}$ matrix (with usually $d^{(l)}\ge d^{(l+1)}$) which  compacts all the aggregations, since: 

$$
(\tilde{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{H}^{(l)})_{ij}=
\langle\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_{i:},\mathbf{H}^{(l)}_{j:}\rangle = 
\sum_{j}\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_{ij}\mathbf{H}^{(l)}_{ij}\;.
$$

Note that the matrix $\tilde{\mathbf{A}}$ is kept constant along all the layers (unless we apply *rewiring*).

### Graph Attention Networks 
The (above) vanilla GNN was introduced by [Kipf & Welling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907). Later on, [Gilmer et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212) coined the term Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and reviewed emerging variants of the vanilla model. In particular, the Kipf-Welling model has an spectral interpretation for modulating message passing (we will get back to this point later on). 

Vanilla GNNs (aka **Graph Convolutional Networks** or **GCNs**) have an important **limitation**: they **<span style="color:#2f6004">blindly aggregate messages coming from all neighbors</span>**: 
- This is effective in homophilic regimes where neighors do not only share labels but do have similar feature vectors. 
- In more general settings, however, neighboring features can be quite different even when their corresponding nodes share the same label.
- If this **constant attention** is hold (all messages are born equal) we may bias the aggregation and thus create a **sub-optimal latent space**.  

**Graph Attention Networks** or **GATs**, by [Velickovic et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10903),  address this problem by computing and learning **attention coefficients** $\alpha_{ij}$ as follows: 

1) Given an edge $(i,j)$ in the graph, its *un-normalized attention coefficient* (after projection of node embeddings $\mathbf{h}_i$ and $\mathbf{h}_j$) are: 

$$
e_{ij}:=\mathbf{a}\left(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i,\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i\right)\;,
$$

where $\mathbf{a}:\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a MLP parameterized by $\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{2d}$. Why?

2. This MLP *concatenates* the inputs $\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i$, and $\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j$ where the notation is 

$$
\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i||\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j\;,
$$

and this is why $\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{2d}$. 

3. Given a concatenation $\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i||\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j$ the MLP proceeds as follows: 

$$
\alpha_{ij}:=\text{Softmax}(e_{ij})=\frac{\exp(e_{ij})}{\sum_{k\in {\cal N}(i)} \exp(e_{ik})}
$$

where, in the following, ${\cal N}(i)$ is equivalent by default to ${\cal N}(i)\cup \{i\}$ (includes itself). 

In more detail, we have 

$$
\alpha_{ij}:=\frac{\exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}^T(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i||\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j)\right)}{\sum_{k\in {\cal N}(i)}\exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}^T(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i||\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_k)\right)}\;,
$$

where $\text{LeakyReLU}$ denotes the [corresponding non-linearity with negative slope](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LeakyReLU.html). 

4. Once we have computed the $\alpha_{ij}$ (as in the Transformer), we use them to UPDATE the state: 

$$
\mathbf{h}^{(l+1)}_i:=\sigma\left(\sum_{j\in{\cal N}(i)}\alpha_{ij}\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}^{(l)}_j\right)\;.
$$

5. Finally, as in the Transformer (although omitted by clarity) we may learn different types of attention. This is called **multi-head attention** and now $\mathbf{h}'_i$ is the concatenation of $K$ different attentional results as follows: 

$$
\mathbf{h}^{(l+1)}_i:=||_{k=1}^K \sigma\left(\sum_{j\in{\cal N}(i)}\alpha_{ij}^k\mathbf{W}^k\mathbf{h}^{(l)}_j\right)\;.
$$

In other words, the same message is projected in a different way and modulated by the specific set of coefficients for this $k$ attentional head. The final result is the concatenation of all the partial results.

6. Concatenation works well in intermediate GAT layers but if we have a final GAT layer previous to softmaxing, it is better to average the outputs produced by each attention head: 

$$
\mathbf{h}^{(l+1)}_i:=\sigma\left(\frac{1}{K}\sum_k\sum_{j\in{\cal N}(i)}\alpha_{ij}^k\mathbf{W}^k\mathbf{h}^{(l)}_j\right)\;.
$$

This is summarized in {numref}`GAT`. On the left, we illustrate the MLP for computing the attention coefficients. Right: hypothetical graph with $K=3$ attention heads (different colors). Visualize this as $K$ superposed graphs whose nodal representation of different colors should be concatenated (or averaged). In this figure, we have preserved the traditional vector notation (arrows).

### Homophily vs Heterophily
#### The Cora Dataset
Let us exemplify the advantages of vanilla GNNs vs MLPs and GATs **in the homophilic regime** with the study of the [Cora dataset](https://graphsandnetworks.com/the-cora-dataset/). This is a graph of 2708 scientific publications as nodes. The nodes are classified into one of $C=7$ classes attenting to their publication's type. The features of each node is a 0/1 vector indicating the absence/presence of a word in a dictionary of $d=1433$ words. There are $5429$ (directed) links indicating that one papers cites another paper. In {numref}`Cora` we show the largest connected compoment of Cora using undirected edges as in [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): 

```{figure} ./images/Topic1/Cora.png
---

```

**Know your dataset**. The basic statistics of Cora are in {numref}`Cora-Stats`. Note that in addition to the number of nodes and their degree, there are some specifications for the train-test split. In particular, in the following experiment **only $5\%$ of the nodes are used for training**. 

```{figure} ./images/Topic1/Cora-Stats.png

```

**Homophily degree**. A fundamental statistic for understanding whether GNNs can beat MLPs is the fraction of nodes whose neighbors do have the same class. This is the so-called **edge-homophily ratio**: 

$$
h = \frac{|\{(v_i, v_j) \in E : y_i = y_j\}|}{|E|}
$$

If $h=0$, it is expected that MLP beats GNNs, whereas for $h=1$ it is expected the opposite. For Cora, we have that $h^{Cora}=0.81$ which indicates that aggregation is more promising than MLPs for **semi-supervised node classification**.

**Comparing MLPs, vanilla GNNs and GATs**. We follow the general trend of using two layers + softmax. Remember that a MLP can be seen as a **sequence of downscaling composing functions** taking the initial feature dimension $\text{num_features}=1433$, mapping the to a $\text{hidden dimension}=16$ and finally to the $\text{num_classes}=7$. This follows the quasi-logarithmic downscaling rule 
$
O(10^3)\rightarrow O(10^1)\rightarrow O(10^0)\;.
$ 

The Torch snippet is given below: 

```
from torch.functional import F
from torch.nn import Linear
class MLP(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self,hidden_channels = 16):
        super(MLP, self).__init__()
        # 2-layer MLP
        self.lin1 = Linear(dataset.num_features, hidden_channels)
        self.lin2 = Linear(hidden_channels, dataset.num_classes)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        # edge_index is not used
        x = self.lin1(x)
        x = x.relu()
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
        x = self.lin2(x)
        return x.softmax(dim=1)
```

For the GCN and GAT layers we use two convolutional layers + softmax. The convolutional layers (respectively $\text{GCNConv}$ and $\text{GATConv}$ are provided by Pytorch Geometric):  

```
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv
from torch.functional import F
'''
    In PyTorch, you define a model by subclassing torch.nn.Module and defining a forward() method which receives input data and returns output data.

        return x.softmax(dim=1) # Log softmax activation
```

For the GAT we use a single **attention head** (set by default)

**Latent spaces**. We train the above models with the **train/test/validaton split** of $48/32/20$: $48\%$ of the nodes for training, $32\%$ for testing and $20\%$ for validations. First we split the nodes in $80\%$ for training and $20\%$ for testing. Then we split the training nodes in $48\%$ for training and $32\%$ for validation over the $80\%$ of the nodes.

We perform $10$ runs with with same random seeds. In {numref}`Cora-Latent` we show the [t-SNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) projections of the respective latent spaces.

---
Cora: GCN (vanilla GNN), MLP and GAT latent spaces. Image generated by PyTorch Geometric. 
```
In {numref}`Cora-Accuracy` we show the respective accuracies. As expected in an homophilic dataset, where the power of aggregation is maximal, both GCN (vanilla GNN) and GAT outperform the MLP. Here are the means and stds for the respective ten runs of each each model: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{GCN:}\; 80.55 \pm 1.18\\
\text{MLP:}\; 75.42 \pm 1.50\\
\text{GAT:}\; 79.37 \pm 1.48\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that GCN slightly improves GAT since in the homophilic setting the value of attention is overrided by aggregation. In other words, making different neighboring nodes that tend to be similar has no point. In this case, the GAT tends to inhibit such attention.

#### The Texas Dataset
Texas dataset is included in [WebKB dataset](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.WebKB.html). The WebKB is a webpage dataset collected from computer science departments of various universities by Carnegie Mellon University. We use one of the three subdatasets of it, Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, where nodes represent web pages, and edges are hyperlinks between them. Node features are the bag-of-words representation of web pages. The web pages are manually classified into $C=5$ categories, student, project, course, staff, and faculty.

The Texas homophily is quite small: $h^{Texas}=0.11$. This means that the likelihood of finding two neighboring nodes with the same label is $0.11$. 

```{figure} ./images/Topic1/Texas.png

**Results**. Training the three models under the same conditions as above, we obtain the following latent spaces.

```

These latent spaces are quite ilustrative of the power of MLP vs leveraging the graph structure as in GCN of GAT. In this heterophilic regime where is very likely that neighboring nodes have different labels, the best choice is undoubtely the MLP: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{GCN:}\; 84.05 \pm 6.22\\
\text{MLP:}\; 92.16 \pm 4.59\\
\text{GAT:}\; 81.08 \pm 7.93\\
\end{aligned}
$$

---
Texas: GCN (vanilla GNN), MLP and GAT accuracies. Image generated by PyTorch Geometric. 
```

Indeed, the GCN outperforms the GAT. However, in general terms, GATs tend to have a similar performance to that of the MLP. Note that herein we are using a single attention head. Increasing the number of heads improves the results but not enough to beat the MLP in general. 

#### Solving Heterophily
Solving the heterophilic problem seems a long shot for GATs. The main reason is that GATs **cannot jump** neighbors to find homologs. This is the case of [Diffusion-Jump GNNs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608024007548). The basic architecture of networks are summarized in {numref}`DJ`:

```{figure} ./images/Topic1/D-J-Architecture.png
---
name: DJ
width: 800px
align: center
height: 300px
---
Diffusion-Jumps GNNs. Multi-hop attention. 
```

The ingredients of the approach are as follows: 
1) **Multi-Hop** arquitecture. Instead of stacking GNN layers, we combine different layers in parallel (vertically). Each layer encodes a **jump** over the input graph. The first one $J^0$ corresponds to the MLP (no jump). Then, we have $J^1,J^2,\ldots,J^K$. 
2) **Distance-slicing**. The jump order $0,1,2,\ldots,K$ is given by slicing the distances between nodes. Thus, layer $J^k$ links nodes whose distance is greater than those linked at $J^{k-1}$ and smaller or equal than those linked at $J^{k+1}$. Distances are provided by a method called **diffusion** (basically a random-walk distance). 
3) **Adjacency**. The original adjacency, denoted jump $J^K$ is added to deal with homophilic graphs, where no jump is required. In advance, we do not know whether the graph is homophilic or not.  
4) **Attention coefficients** Each layer $k$ produces an embedding $\mathbf{h}_k$ and we learn attention coefficients $\alpha_k$ so that the best combination of jumps is used in classification. This adds flexibility to the classifier. Note that $\sum_{k=1}^K\alpha_k=1$ as in softmax.

Diffusion-Jumps GNNs performance wrt alternatives. 
```

In {numref}`DJ-Table`, we show that Diffusion-Jump GNNs outperform the alternatives for many heterophilic graphs, in particular the MLP. 

## Algorithmic Neuralization 
### Neural Algorithmic Reasoning  
Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) stands for the **<span style="color:#2f6004">simulation/approximation of algorithms via neural architectures</span>**. In this regard, it is key to: 
1) Envision the algorithm ${\cal A}$ as a function ${\cal A}:\mathbf{I}\rightarrow\mathbf{O}$ which maps inputs to outputs. 

2) Given the inputs in $\mathbf{I}$, the algorithm ${\cal A}$ is a [computable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function): it basically (i) manipulates the input, (ii) builds internal/auxiliar variables, and (iii) produces the desired output in $\mathbf{O}$. 

3) Find a Neural Network that **aligns well** with ${\cal A}'s$ computations. What does it mean?

### Algoritmic Alignment 
The best example of algorithmic alignment is **Dynamic Programing** (DP). Actually, DPs and GNNs interplay happens as follows: 

1) **Implicit graph structure**. Many DP algorithms (shortest path, MST) operate naturally on a graph, but all of them can be set as a multi-stage graph where local decisions become part of optimal ones. For instance, the equation 

$$
x[v] = \min_{u\in {\cal N}(v)}x[u] + w(u,v)\;.
$$

encodes a [relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(iterative_method)) step where the shortest distance $x[v]$ between vertex $v$ and origin $s$ is updated on behalf of is neighbors $u$ and the weigths $w(u,v)$. Other non-graph algorithms such as the DP solver of the knapsack problem can be possed in a similar way. 

2) **Nodes and messages**. The target of NAR is to **chase a nodal latent space** whose decoding mimics the performance of the classical algorithm. These latent representations are proxys of the variables and they are placed in the nodes. Then, their update can be seen as message passing + invariant aggregation. This is illustrated in {numref}`BF-Align`. 

```{figure} ./images/Topic1/Bellman-Align.png

height: 300px
---
Bellman-Ford Alignment. Adapted from [Neural Execution of Algorithms](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume24/21-0449/21-0449.pdf). 
```
Note that $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{M}$ are MLPs and $\bigoplus$ is the invariant aggregation function (MAX,SUM,MEAN). 

3) **NAR is Data-driven**. Despite the nice alignment between GNNs and DP algorithms, NAR trains these GNNs by scrapping the algorithm variables (e.g. distances, pointers) and finding latent spaces whose reconstruction matches the desired result via backpropagation. As **<span style="color:#2f6004">NAR does not ensures that the resulting NN reduces the complexity of the original algorithm</span>**, it only provides an explanation of how the GNN generalizes to unseen instances. 

### Combinatorial Neuralization
In this subject, we shift the focus to **combinatorial problems**, where neuralization is more challenging. These problems are usually NP-Hard. If so, there exist **polynomial approximations** for some of them. Think for instance of the **normalized cut** (optimal bipartition), which is nicely approximated by the Fiedler vector. In this case, the polynomial approximation relies on computing the second eigenvector of the graph Laplacian. 

Very recently, [Ahmed Begga's PhD Thesis](https://rua.ua.es/entities/publication/3bff3b7f-f7cf-4fb5-a430-d7c4c0ca99ff) has addressed the problem of **<span style="color:#2f6004">neuralizing spectral clustering</span>**. Some inspiring ideas: 

1) **Mathematical formulation**. Computing the main $k$ eigenvectors $\mathbf{x}_i$, columns of the $|V|\times k$ matrix $\mathbf{X}$, of the normalized Laplacian ${\cal L}$ has a closed mathematical formulation: 

$$
\mathbf{X} = \arg\min_{\Omega} f(\mathbf{X}):=\sum_{i=1}^K\mathbf{x}_i^T{\cal L}\mathbf{x}_i\;\;\text{s.t}\;\; \mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{I}\;.
$$

In other words, $f(\mathbf{X})$ is a loss that we have to minimize in order to learn $\mathbf{X}$ whose columns must be mutually perpendicular. Numerical solvers such as the [Lanczos method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm) proceed in a different way, but they **cannot scale for very large graphs**. 

2) **Double loss**. From a GNN viewpoint, the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ must be generated by $|V|$ embeddings using message passing + invariant aggregation. These embeddings must be, in general, not only compatible with the $L_{eig}:=f(\mathbf{X})$ loss, but also with that of downstream task (node classification, graph classification, link prediction) that the GNN attemps to solve. We minimize $L_{eig} + L_{task}$.

3) **Empirical Eigenvectors**. Minimizing $L_{eig} + L_{task}$ leads to data-driven eigenvectors $\mathbf{X}$. In other words, they are orthogonal but biased towards solving the task. For instance, they absorb the label information to contribute to classify graphs or to be good positional encoders in Graph Transformers. 

4) **Generalization**. Learning eigenvectors is not yet graph dependent since they can be transferred to other graphs with similar spectral properties. The main questions are (1) **<span style="color:#2f6004">what graphs support a better approximation of their eigenvectors</span>** and (2) **<span style="color:#2f6004">how expressive is the generalization</span>**.

In the following, we are going to apply these lessons to neuralize the **Maximum Clique problem**, another NP-Hard problem yet studied in previous courses. 

#### The Maximum Clique  
**Maximum Clique**. Remember that given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, with $n=|V|$ nodes and edges $E\subseteq V\times V$, whe have: 

- A *clique* is a subset $C\subseteq V$ of nodes where all nodes are mutually adjacent. In other words, they induce a complete subgraph $K_{|C|}$ of size $|C|$ in $G$. 
- A *maximal clique* is a clique not contained in another larger clique. 

- The *maximum clique* is the maximal clique with the largest cardinality. 

For instance, for the graph in {numref}`Clique-Toy`, with $n=5$ nodes, the maximum clique is given by $U = \{1,2,3\}$ with cardinality $3$. However, there are two maximal cliques: (a) the one defined by the edge $(3,4)$, with cardinality $2$ and (b) the one defined by the isolated node $5$, with obvious cardinality $1$.

```

**NP-Hard**. The problem of finding the maximum clique in $G$ is known to be NP-Hard since: a) its brute-force method requires exploring all the $2^n$ subsets of $G$ (subsetness flavor), and b) there is not a polynomial algorithm known, solving it exactly. 

#### Bron-Kerbosh Algorithm 
The [Bron-Kerbosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron%E2%80%93Kerbosch_algorithm) (BK) algorithm  *enumerates* all the maximal cliques of an input graph $G$.

```{prf:algorithm} Bron-Kerbosh
:label: Bellman-Ford

**Inputs** Given a graph $G=(V,E)$

**Output** Returns all its maximal cliques. 

**function** $\text{BK}$($R$, $P$, $X$): 

1. **if** $P=\emptyset$ and $X=\emptyset$ **then** **return** $R$ 

2. **for** each $v\in P$: 

    1. $\text{BK}$($R\cup \{v\}$, $P\cap {\cal N}(v)$, $X\cap {\cal N}(v)$)
    2. $P = P-\{v\}$
    3. $X = X\cup \{v\}$
```

The algorithm is initially called with $\text{BK}(\emptyset,V,\emptyset)$ showing that: 

- $R$ is the **current clique**. This set will grow in each recursive call (step $2.1$). 
- $P$ is the **candidate set**. This set considers only the neighours of the current vertex $v$ (step $2.1$) and $v$ is excluded from it when a recursive call backtracks (step $2.2$).  
- $X$ is the **exclusion set**. This set considers only the neighours of the current vertex $v$ that have been yet excluded (step $2.1$) and $v$ is included in it when a recursive call backtracks (step $2.3$). 
- **Backtracking** happens when either $P\neq\emptyset$ or $X\neq\emptyset$.

Applying the algorithm to {numref}`Clique-Toy`, the resulting execution tree in {numref}`BK-exex` shows how the maximal cliques (red leaves of the tree) are built level-by-level, i.e. increnentally. 

In the worst case, this incremental execution explores the $2^{n}$ subsets of $V$ to determine whether they form a clique as well as its  corresponding size.

The recursion is initiated by setting R and X to be the empty set and P to be the vertex set of the graph. Within each recursive call, the algorithm considers the vertices in P in turn; if there are no such vertices, it either reports R as a maximal clique (if X is empty), or backtracks. For each vertex v chosen from P, it makes a recursive call in which v is added to R and in which P and X are restricted to the neighbor set N(v) of v, which finds and reports all clique extensions of R that contain v. Then, it moves v from P to X to exclude it from consideration in future cliques and continues with the next vertex in P.

#### The Motzkin-Strauss Relaxation 
One of the more intriguing aspects of the polinomial approximators for  NP-Hard problems is that they are **<span style="color:#2f6004">contiuous</span>**<span style="color:#2f6004">: the original discrete problem is transformed into a continous one to avoid the combinatorial explosion</span>. 

For the Maximum Clique, the Bron-Kerbosk algorithmic enumeration takes $O(2^n)$ steps in the worst case since it **builds the solution step-by-step**, i.e. incrementally. 

However, a continuous version of Bron-Kerbosh **should suggest to explore a complete solution at a time**. 

How can this be done? 

**The simplex**. Consider, for instance, the cherry graph in {numref}`Cherry-Simplex`. Since the graph has three vertices, $n=3$, we are going to encode a candidate clique as a 3-dimensional vector $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ where the component $x_i$ encodes **the probability that the vertex $i$ belongs to the clique**. As a result, we have $x_1 + x_2 + x_3=1$ and $x_i\ge 0$ for $i=1,2,3$. This space, denoted as $\Delta_3$, and encoding all the probability distributions of $3$ variables is called the **simplex**. 

Let us focus on {numref}`Cherry-Simplex`:

```

- **First-order cliques**. As we have $n=3$ nodes, the simplex can be  represented by a triangle. The vertices of these triangle are respectively $\mathbf{x}^{\{1\}}=(1,0,0)$, $\mathbf{x}^{\{2\}}=(0,1,0)$ and $\mathbf{x}^{\{3\}}=(0,0,1)$. These vertices *encode cliques of 1 node*, and the node is the one whose index is $1$. 

- **Second-order cliques**. The cherry graph has 2 cliques of size 2: $\{1,3\}$ and $\{2,3\}$. These cliques are encoded as follows: $\mathbf{x}^{\{1,3\}}=(0.5,0,0.5)$ and $\mathbf{x}^{\{2,3\}}=(0,0.5,0.5)$. Note that this is because the cliques do represent probability distributions. 

- **Third-order cliques**. Since $n=3$, it could be possible to have a clique of size 3: if the edge $(1,3)$ does exist we should have that $\mathbf{x}^{\{1,2,3\}}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ is a valid clique where each node has the same probability of being in it. 


Although there are not third-order cliques in the cherry graph, the simplex $\Delta_3$ includes points that encode them. This is the problem of a continuous representation: **<span style="color:#2f6004">all the possible cliques of a graph with $n$ nodes are encoded in $\Delta_n$ but they do not necessarilly exist</span>**.  

**The cost function**. Given the simplex as the **search space** of our maximum clique, we should design a cost function $f(\mathbf{x})$ for $\mathbf{x}\in\Delta_n$ which is **<span style="color:#2f6004">maximum for large cliques</span>**. But **only those exixting** in the graph!

Not surprisingly,a good candidate is the (quadratic) function $\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix. Why? 

1) <ins>Out of the simplex</ins>. The **characteristic** vector $\mathbf{x}\in\{0,1\}^n$, **encodes of a subset** $U\subseteq V$, if we set $x_i=1$ if $i\in U$ and  $x_i=0$ otherwise. Then, $\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ **<span style="color:#2f6004">counts twice the number of edges between the nodes in $U$</span>**.  

*Intuition*. Let $\mathbf{A}$ be symmetric with zero diagonal (the graph is undirected and it does not have self-loops). Then, each row $i$ of the column vector $(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x})_i$ tells us how many neighbors of node $i$ do belong to the subset $U$ encoded by $\mathbf{x}$. 

As an example, consider the adjacency of the cherry graph: 

$$
\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

and the column vector $\mathbf{x}=[1\;1\;0]^T$, encoding the subset $U=\{1,2\}$ we have 

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
1\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &\text{node 1 has 0 neighors in U}\\
1 &\;\text{node 2 has 0 neighors in U}\\
2 &\;\text{node 3 has 2 neighors in U: 1 and 2}\;.\\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

Now, for deciphering the meaning of $\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ in this setting, take now the "square" in our example: 

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0\\
2\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 1\cdot 0 + 1\cdot 0 + 0\cdot 0 = 0\;,
$$

showing that the elements $U=\{1,2\}$ are *not connected*. In other words, there is no edge between them! 

However, if we include node 3 in the set, we have (for $U=\{1,2,3\}$) and $\mathbf{x}=[1\;1\;1]^T$: 

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}= 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
1\\
1\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &\text{node 1 has 1 neighor in U: 3}\\
1 &\;\text{node 2 has 1 neighors in U: 3}\\
2 &\;\text{node 3 has 2 neighors in U: 1 and 2}\;.\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And now the "square" is 

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
1\\
2\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 2 = 4\;,
$$

showing that there are $2$ edges between the nodes in $U$. 

*Proof*. Since $A_{ij}=1$ when there is an edge between $i$ and $j$,  the expression $\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ can be rewritten as follows:  

$$
\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}:=\sum_{i\in V}x_i\sum_{j\in V}A_{ij}x_j =\sum_{i\in V}\sum_{j\in V}x_iA_{ij}x_j = 2\cdot \sum_{(i,j)\in E}x_ix_j\;.
$$

Note that in the above expression we count the undirected edge $(i,j)$ twice (as $(i,j)$ and as $(j,i)$) if $\mathbf{A}$ is symmetric. 


2) <ins>In the simplex</ins>. Let $C = \{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}$ a clique of size $k$. The simplex coordinates of the $n\ge k$ nodes are: $\frac{1}{k}$ if the vertex belongs to $C$ and $0$ otherwise.

Since $x_i$ is not zero *only* for $i\in C$ we have: 

$$
\sum_{i\in V}\sum_{j\in V}x_iA_{ij}x_j = \sum_{i\in C}\sum_{j\in C}x_iA_{ij}x_j =\sum_{i\in C}\sum_{j\in C}\frac{1}{k}A_{ij}\frac{1}{k} = \frac{1}{k^2}\sum_{i\in C}\sum_{j\in C}A_{ij}\;.
$$

As in a clique of size $k$, every vertex is linked with $k-1$ other vertices, we can rewrite the above expression as 

$$
\frac{1}{k^2}\sum_{i\in C}\sum_{j\in C, j\neq i}A_{ij}\;.
$$

How to evaluate the above double sum? 
For each i, there are $k-1$ elements in C different from it. Therefore, the double sum is $k\cdot (k-1)$: 

$$
\sum_{i\in C}\sum_{j\in C, j\neq i}A_{ij} = k\cdot (k-1)\;.
$$

As a result, **<span style="color:#2f6004">for $\mathbf{x}$ encoding a clique</span>** we have: 

$$
\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\frac{k\cdot (k-1)}{k^2}=\frac{k-1}{k} = 1 - \frac{1}{k}\;.
$$

As $k$ increases, its inverse decreases and then $\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ grows with the size of the clique!

**Continuous formulation of the Maximum Clique**. Given an undirected  graph $G=(V,E)$ with nodes $V=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, edges $E\subseteq V\times V$, and adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$, the maximum clique is given by the following point in the simplex $\Delta_n$: 

$$
\mathbf{x}^{\ast}= \arg\max_{\mathbf{x}\in\Delta_n}f(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\;.
$$

If the clique number $\omega(G)=k$, i.e. the maximum clique $C$ has size $k$, then $f(\mathbf{x})= 1 - \frac{1}{k}$ and $\mathbf{x}^{\ast}$ is as follows: 

$$
\mathbf{x}^{\ast}_i =
\begin{cases}
     \frac{1}{k} &\;\text{if}\; i\in C \\[2ex]
     0&\;\text{otherwise}\\[2ex]
\end{cases}
$$

**Spurious solutions**. As the simplex $\Delta_n$ is continuous, it is possible that do exist **maximizers** of $f(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ **that do not correspond to maximum cliques**. This is the case of $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}=(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2})$ in {numref}`Cherry-Simplex` (the cherry graph). Let us see what is the cost of this solution: 

$$
\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{2}\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{4}\\
\frac{1}{4}\\
\frac{1}{2}\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{2}\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\\
\end{bmatrix} = 
2\cdot \frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}=0.5\;.
$$

Note that the cherry graph does not have cliques of size $3$ and all their cliques of size $2$ ($\mathbf{x}^{\{1,3\}}=(\frac{1}{2},0,\frac{1}{2}))$ and $\mathbf{x}^{\{2,3\}}=(0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$) have also a cost of $0.5$ (please check). 

Therefore,  **<span style="color:#2f6004">spurious solutions</span>**<span style="color:#2f6004"> are solutions having maximal value but their representation do not correspond to a maximum clique</span>. 

**Modified cost function**. The maths linking the Maximum Clique problem with the maximization of $\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ date from the sixties and they are due to Motzkin-Strauss. In the nineties, with the birth of **energy minimization methods**, they were updated by my colleague [Marcello Pelillo et al.](https://www.dsi.unive.it/~pelillo/papers/NeuralComputation%201999.pdf). In this regard, they proposed the following cost function for avoiding spurious solutions: 

$$
\hat{f}(\mathbf{x}):= \underbrace{\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}}_{f(\mathbf{x})} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{x}\;.
$$

We have **two intepretations for the new cost function**: 
1) **Regularization**. As $\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{x}=\sum_{i}x_i^2$, if two solutions do have the same $f(\mathbf{x})$ value, we prefer the one with the largest modulus (i.e. smallest values of their denominators). In the above example (cherry graph), note that 

$$
\hat{f}(\mathbf{x}^{\{1,3\}}) = 0.5 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 0^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\right) = 0.5 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{6}{16} = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75\;,
$$

$$
\hat{f}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}) = 0.5 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\right) = 0.5 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{4} = 0.5 + 0.1875 = 0.6875\;.
$$

2) **Half self-loop**. As $\hat{f}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{x}^T\left(\mathbf{A} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{I}\right)\mathbf{x}$, we bias the adjacency by introducing self loops as in a GNN. The weight of each self loop is formally $1/2$ and this is equivalent to regularization. 

Whereas **regularizarion** reduces the costs of spurious solutions, **self-loops** do the same by enforcing self-loops in the diagonal of the adjacency. 

#### Replicator Dynamics 
The simplex and the cost function associated with it is just the first step to solve the Maximum Clique problem, even in a continuous way. We need a **continous search procedure** to find $\mathbf{x}^{\ast}$. 

**Replicator equation**. We are going to **<span style="color:#2f6004">play an evolutionary game</span>** known as the  [replicator equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_equation). 

Suppose we want to find the point $\mathbf{x}^{\ast}$ starting from any other point $\mathbf{x}(0)$ by means of a (continous) trajectory: 

$$
\mathbf{x}(t)\rightarrow\mathbf{x}(t+1)=\mathbf{x}(t)+d\mathbf{x}(t)\cdot dt\;
$$

that we expect to converge to $\mathbf{x}^{\ast}$. The trajectory is governed by the following differential equations (one per dimension): 
  
$$
dx_i(t) = x_i(t)\cdot\left(\pi_i(t)-\phi(t)\right)\;\text{for}\;\;i=1,2,\ldots,n\;, 
$$

where

$$
\phi(t)=\sum_{j=1}^n\pi_j(t)x_j(t)\;.
$$

In the above formulation, we have that:

1) $x_i(t)$ defines the proportion of **type** $i$ at time $t$ in a population: $\sum_i x_i(t)=1$ as in the simplex. 

2) $\pi_i(t)$ defines the **fitness of type** i at time $t$. 

3) $\phi(t)$ defines the **average fitness** of all the types. 

This formulation models **natural selection** since strategies (types) with fitness larger than the average increase in frequency whereas the others decrease along time (assuming a static population). 

Note that the process stops when $dx_i(t)=0$ for all $i$. In other words, the process **<span style="color:#2f6004">converges to a types distribution (point in the $\Delta_n$ simplex) where $\pi_i(t)=\phi_i(t)$ for all $i$</span>**. 

**Replicator dynamics for the Maximum Clique**. In order to apply the above equations to find $\mathbf{x}^{\ast}$ we define $\pi_i(t)$ and $\phi_i(t)$ as follows: 

- *Payoff matrix*. The adjacency $\mathbf{A}$ is assumed to be a payoff matrix. . A component $A_{ij}$ (or in general $W_{ij}\ge 0$)represents the payoff of an individual playing strategy $i$ against an opponent playing strategy $j$.

This is a simple linear model that means that payoff is "proportional" to current fitness

- Therefore: given $\pi(t)=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t)$, $\pi_i(t)$ means the **expected payoff** for $i$ since $\pi_i(t)=\sum_{j=1}^nA_{ij}x_j(t)$.

- Then, the **mean payoff** for the entire population is 

$$
\phi_i(t)=\sum_{i=1}^n\pi_i(t)x_j(t)=\sum_{i=1}^nA_{ij}x_i(t)x_j(t)=\mathbf{x}(t)^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t)\;.
$$

- Therefore, for the Maximum Clique we have the following equations: 

$$
dx_i(t) = x_i(t)\left((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t))_i-\mathbf{x}(t)^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t)\right)\;.
$$

As a result 

$$
x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + x_i(t)\left((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t))_i-\mathbf{x}(t)^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t)\right)\cdot dt\;. 
$$

Then we normalize $\mathbf{x}(t+1)$ so that it is still inside the simplex $\Delta_n$: 

$$
x_i(t+1)\leftarrow \frac{x_i(t+1)}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(t+1)}\;.
$$

These calculations are translated to the following algorithm (Replicator Dynamics):

```{prf:algorithm} Replicator Dynamics
:label: R-D

**Inputs** Given an initial $\mathbf{x}(0)\in\Delta_n$

**Output** Convergence point  $\mathbf{x}^{\ast}=\mathbf{x}(T)$ after $T$ generations. 

$dt = 0.001$

**for** $t=0,1,\ldots,T-1$: 

1. $
d\mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{x}(t)\ast\left(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t)-\mathbf{x}(t)^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t)\right)\;.
$

2. $\mathbf{x}(t+1) = \mathbf{x}(t) + d\mathbf{x}(t)\cdot dt\;.$

3. $\mathbf{x}(t+1)=\frac{\mathbf{x}(t)}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(t+1)}\;.$

**return** $\mathbf{x}(T)$
```

where $\ast$ is the **componentwise product**: $\mathbf{x}\ast\mathbf{y}=\sum_ix_iy_i$. 

**Initialization**. The usual (neutral) initialization for this algorithm is $\mathbf{x}(0) = (\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n},\ldots,\frac{1}{n})$ (this is the uniform distribution or **<span style="color:#2f6004">barycenter</span>**). 

**Iterations**. In this version, both $T$ and $dt$ specify a fixed number of iterations. The algorithm can be improved by stopping when  $\max_i|x_i(t+1)-x_i(t)|<\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a tolerance. 

**Example**. Let us get the graph in {numref}`Clique-Toy` with $n=5$ nodes and explore its replicator dynamics. 

The adjacency is as follows: 

$$
\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The barycenter is $\mathbf{x}(0)=\left(\frac{1}{5},\frac{1}{5},\frac{1}{5},\frac{1}{5}\right)$. 

Using $dt=0.01$ and $T=5000$, the first $5$ points of the trajectory are: 
```
[[0.2        0.2        0.2        0.2        0.2       ]
 [0.20016    0.20016    0.20056    0.19976    0.19936   ]
 [0.2003199  0.2003199  0.20112006 0.19951974 0.19872039]
 [0.20047971 0.20047971 0.20168017 0.19927923 0.19808118]
 [0.20063942 0.20063942 0.20224032 0.19903847 0.19744237]]
```

where the rows correspond to time steps $0\ldots 4$ and cols to variables $x_1,\ldots,x_5$. 

Note that: 

- $x_1$ becomes equal to $x_2$.
- $x_3$ grows slower than $x_1$ and $x_2$.
- $x_4$ and $x_5$ decrease. 

If we plot $x_i(t)$ separately, as in {numref}`Clique-Toy-RD`, note that the trajectories $x_1(t)$, $x_2(t)$ and $x_3(t)$ (in red) converge to the same point (approximately $0.3333 = \frac{1}{3}$) whereas $x_4(t)$ and $x_5(t)$ converge to $0$, and the algorithm returns $\mathbf{x}(T)=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},0,0)$, showing that the maximum clique is $C=\{1,2,3\}$.

**Increasing Maximization Theorem**. Given a non-negative and symmetric payoff matrix $\mathbf{W}$. Then $f(\mathbf{x}(t))=\mathbf{x}^T(t)\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x}(t)$ is **<span style="color:#2f6004">strictly increasing</span>** <span style="color:#2f6004">along any nonconstant trajectory of Replicator Dynamics.</span>

This means that $\frac{d}{dt}f(\mathbf{x}(t))>0$ i.e $f(\mathbf{x}(t+1))>f(\mathbf{x}(t))$ unless $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is a stationary point. 

In addition, <span style="color:#2f6004">Replicator dymanics converge to a **unique stationary point**</span>. 

Therefore, we can stop the RD when $|ƒ(\mathbf{x}(t+1))-ƒ(\mathbf{x}(t))|<\epsilon$. See for instance in {numref}`Clique-Toy-F` which corresponds to the dymanics in {numref}`Clique-Toy-RD`.

**Limitations**. RD **works well** when the input graph has a unique large clique in comparison with the sizes of other cliques in the graph. This is the case of the graph in {numref}`Clique-Large` with $n=10$ nodes and a unique clique of size $k=4$.

```

As we can see in {numref}`Clique-Large-RD`, variables $x_0$, $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_5$ converge to $\frac{1}{4}$, whereas the remaining variables converge to zero. Then, the solution $\mathbf{x}(T)=(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},0,0,\frac{1}{4},0,0,0,0)$ is consistent with the maximum clique $C=\{0,1,2,5\}$.

However, **<span style="color:#2f6004">RD works not so well when there are some maximal (not maximum) cliques competing with the MC</span>**. We address this point in the following exercise. 

<br></br>
<span style="color:#2f6004">

<br></br>
<span style="color:#2f6004"> 
The Replicator Dynamics in {numref}`Clique-Large-RD2` correspond to the same graph, but $G$ has been slightly modified by adding an edge. **Explain what edge can be**. 
</span>
<br></br>
<span style="color:#2f6004"> 
**Answer**. First of all, we observe that RD converges to the same solution as before, i.e. $\mathbf{x}(T)=(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},0,0,\frac{1}{4},0,0,0,0)$. What differs now is **how RD varies in between** $0$ and $T$.
</span> 
<br></br>
<span style="color:#2f6004"> 
Note that $x_3$, not belonging to the Maximal Clique (MC), initially grows, deviating significantly from other vertices that "clearly" do not belong to the MC. This indicates that the new edge seems to be rooted in vertex $3$. 
</span> 
<br></br>
<span style="color:#2f6004"> 
Observing now the dynamics of the vertices beloning to the MC (in red), note that their respective curves are now more different or distant than in {numref}`Clique-Large-RD`. This means that their membership to the MC is not clear in the first stages of the search. 
Again, the most different dynamics are given by $x_0$. 
</span> 
<br></br>
<span style="color:#2f6004"> 
Could we state that $0$ and $3$ are connected? Well, this is plausible since linked nodes tend to share/couple their RDs (this is basically why nodes in the MC converge to the same point). 
</span> 
<br></br>
<span style="color:#2f6004"> 
A nice way of testing this hypothesis is that adding edge $(0,3)$ creates 2 maximal (not maximum) cliques of size 3: $C_1=\{0,3,5\}$ and $C_2=\{0,3,7\}$. The existence of maximal cliques which are **competing with the MC** complicates the RDs and makes them more "open" in the early stages of the search.  
</span> 
<br></br>


#### Integration with GNNs
**Motivation**. In principle, Replicator Dynamics are able of approximating the MC (specially if we use $\mathbf{A}+\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{I}$ instead of $\mathbf{A}$ for avoiding spurious solutions). Actually, this is the method provided by the [Gurobi framework](https://gurobi-optimods.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for finding graph isomorphims via identifying the MC.

However, <span style="color:#2f6004">we want to learn from the experience</span> in order to **<span style="color:#2f6004">initialize the Replicator Dynamics closer to the optimum instead of launching it  at the barycenter</span>**.

**Main idea**. Let us train a GNN to optimize $f(\mathbf{x})$ (or $\hat{f}(\mathbf{x})$). Doing that requires **four** basic steps (see {numref}`GNN-RD`): 

1) **Provide node features**. We need informative node features $\mathbf{x}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ for initializing the nodal embeddings $\mathbf{h}_i$ forming the latent space. These features can be as simple as the node degree or as complex of a positional encoding such as a set of eigenvectors of the Laplacian. 

2) **Add a Softmax layer**. After the final (or $K$) aggregation layer of the GNN we need a linear layer so that an initial simplex point $\mathbf{p}$ can be predicted for all the final nodal embeddings $\mathbf{h}_i^{(K)}$. However, in order to force $\mathbf{p}$ to be a simplex point we "softmax" it, which leads to $\sum_ip_i=1$ and $p_i\ge 0\;\forall i$.

3) **Replicator Dynamics**. In training time, it is possible to add a "few" (3-4) iterations of RD. In this regard, we use the **discrete version of RD**: 

$$
p_i(t+1)=p_i(t)\cdot\frac{(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{p}(t))_i}{\mathbf{p}(t)^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{p}(t)}\;.
$$

This expression is clearly derivable. However, in inference/test time, the same expression is "frozen" and it starts from the initial $\mathbf{p}$ predicted by the NN. 

```{figure} ./images/Topic1/GNN-RD.png

---
Graph Neural Network with RD. Note that RD are derivable (i.e. they contribute to the gradient). Once frozen, they can be used in inference time as well. Herein, the number of iterations is unlimited. 
```

4) **RD Decoder**. In inference/test time, once the NN predicts $\mathbf{p}^{\ast}$ we must extract what nodes belong to the MC using the probabilities in $\mathbf{p}^{\ast}$. We do it as follows: 

```{prf:algorithm} RD-Decoder
:label: R-D-Decoder

**Inputs** Given a final $\mathbf{p}^{\ast}$ and a threshold $\delta\in [0.5,1)$

**Output** Nodes $v_i\in G$ forming the MC. 

1. $p^{\ast}_{\sigma(1)}\ge p^{\ast}_{\sigma(2)}\ge,\ldots,\ge p^{\ast}_{\sigma(n)} = \text{Sort}(-\mathbf{p}^{\ast})$

2. ${\cal C}=\emptyset$

3. **for** $n\in \{\sigma(1),\sigma(2),\ldots,\sigma(n)\}$: 

    1. **if** $(\mathbf{p}^{\ast}_n < \epsilon)$ & $(|{\cal C}|>0)$
**then** **break**

    2. **if** $\text{Can_Extend}({\cal C},n)$ 
    **then** ${\cal C}={\cal C}\cup \{n\}$

**return** ${\cal C}$
```

This RD-Decoder is really simple. It is a greedy strategy that starts with high probability nodes and adds them to the candidate MC provided that: (a) the probability is good enough, and (b) the added node forms a clique wrt to the existing nodes in the clique.
