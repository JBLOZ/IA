Response Length evaluation. 

Project Overview 

Welcome to Cypher RLHF. You’ll guide the AI model through natural, real-world conversations, 
ensuring its responses are accurate, relevant, and reflect how users interact in everyday 
scenarios. 
 
Your input is vital to refining the AI’s ability to learn from real interactions. We’re excited to have 
you involved in this project as we strive to enhance the model’s capabilities. 
 

Task Attempt Workflow 

Here are the steps in a Cypher task: 
● Write prompt 
● Rate Model Responses 
● Rank Your Preference 
● Rewrite Response 

 
IMPORTANT! ChatGPT or other AI tools are NOT PERMITTED to create prompts or 
evaluate responses. Using AI tools will result in a flag on your account for removal from 
the project and can lead to eventual removal from the platform 
 

Task Overview - This is a single turn project 

 



Step 1: Writing a Prompt 
 

● On the right hand side of the task, you will be provided with a prompt category, please 
create a prompt based on this prompt category.  

● The goal is to write unique, creative, diverse prompts that adhere to the prompt 
categories. The prompts should be natural, reasonable prompts for a real user to ask.  
In doing so we aim to have tangible differences between two model responses. 

● Prompts should not ask the model for information that requires knowledge after April 
30, 2024. 

● Some prompts may need a reference text, some prompts may not need a reference  
text. Reference text should be in target language. 

● Either the prompt OR reference text must be localized. Localization means the model’s 
response feels authentic and relevant to a specific region or country. This involves: 

○ Reflecting Local Knowledge: Knowing key locations, customs, and events. 
○ Understanding Regional Nuances: Adapting references to suit cultural norms. 
○ Meeting Specific Needs: Addressing local laws, regulations, or processes. 
○ Tailoring to Cultural Context: Ensuring the response is closely adapted to the 

cultural background of the target audience. 

Step 1.5: Iterating on a prompt 
 

● When generated, prompts must produce two responses with clear differences. The 
differences can be quality based (e.g. one makes a mistake), or more subjective (one is 
more thorough or uses different structure). We should NOT force model mistakes at the 
expense of a natural prompt. 

○ PLEASE NOTE: This does NOT mean you should create arbitrary and unnecessary 
constraints, such as “don’t use the letter H” or “bold every other word.” We often 
see attempts to make prompts more complex in the hopes of "confusing" the 
model, when in reality it just produces poor data. Check out our contrived  

prompts section. 
 

Step 1.75: Inserting the Reference Text  
 Clip Icon: 
If you see a clip icon, add the reference text in the box after clicking the clip icon. Please ensure 
that the reference text is entered in the designated input box that appears. 
 
If you don’t see a clip icon, the prompt category does not require a reference text. 
 
Reference text should be from credible/reputable sources. You can source this information from 
Online Articles and Websites, News Outlets, Specialized Blogs and Industry Sites, Books and  
E-Books, Academic Journals and Papers, Government and Official Publications, Open Data 
Repositories, Educational Platforms and Courses, Multimedia Transcripts, Public Domain Text, etc. 
 



A reference text should be between 200 and 400 words. For Japanese and Chinese locales, we 
should aim for 300-600 characters. 

 

Step 2:  Rating each model response according to the dimensions 
 

● There are 7 dimensions including an overall quality score and some direct questions about 
the content of the response. 

 
● The dimensions are: 

○ Localization: Does the response use correct spelling, grammar, and word choice 
for the region? Does it look like it's coming from a local from your locale? 

○ Instruction Following: Does the response do what the contributor asks? Does it 
meet the explicit and implicit requirements of the prompt? 

○ Truthfulness: Is the information factually/contextually accurate? - are there any 
inaccurate statements or misrepresentations of the information? 

○ Response Length: Does the response efficiently deliver only the necessary 
information in a clear, concise, and structured manner without unnecessary 
repetition or filler? Look for length, relevance and repetition. 

○ Structure, Writing Style, and Tone: How well the response reads: does it have  
good structure, appropriate tone, clarity etc. 

○ Harmlessness: The extent to which the written response avoids harmful elements 
such as racism, offensive language, or any content that may cause harm or 
discomfort to others 

○ Overall Satisfaction: When rating the overall satisfaction, prioritize user 
satisfaction over simply counting errors. Consider how happy a user would be if 
they received this response. Although most of the time satisfaction ratings will 
scale with dimension scores, responses that fulfill the user’s request effectively, 
even with minor errors, should be graded more generously, while those that lack 
obvious errors but fail to feel satisfying should be slightly penalized. 
 

● Rate each dimension according to: 
○ 1 - Major Issues 
○ 2 - Minor Issues  



○ 3 - No Issues 
 

● Some dimensions will require a short justification: 
○ Stay brief and specific, only mention what is incorrect. 

 
● Do an overall score of the response: 

○ Take all your individual ratings for the dimensions and provide an overall score for 
the response.  

 

Step 3: Preference ranking on a 1-7 Likert Scale 
 

● Select 1 or 7 if one response is much better than the other response: 
○ One response has no key issues while the other has major issues. 
○ One response is significantly more satisfying than the other. 

 
● Select 2,3 or 5,6 if one response is better or slightly better than the other: 

○ Only relatively minor or subjective differences between the responses. 
○ One response is somewhat more satisfying than the other. 

 

 



Step 3.5: Writing a justification to explain the preference ranking  
 

● Look here for a full rundown on the requirements of a good justification. 
 

● A good justification should:  
○ Provide sufficient evidence from the responses to explain the preference ranking. 
○ Follow these 4 requirements: 

■ Starts with a clear statement of the verdict. 
■ Mentions the 1-2 most critical reasons for the ranking with specific 

evidence from each response. 
■ Is typically 2-3 sentences. 
■ Is edited to trim down any unnecessary information or words. 

 
● If there are multiple issues differentiating the quality of the 2 responses then the focus 

should be on the most prominent ones. 

 

Step 4: Rewriting the selected response  
  

● Look here for a full rundown of how to do response rewrites. 
 

● Rewrites involve fixing the issues you identified in the earlier rating. Prioritize fixing the 
most important issues (e.g. Truthfulness). PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE MORE THAN YOU 
NEED TO. 

 
● [NEW] Limit your rewrite to 20 minutes MAX.  

 
● Rewrite Step by Step Guide: 

○ Read the prompt again. 
○ Fix any critical issues you identified in the prior response rating. Again, please do 

not change more than you need to. Some examples of fixes include: 



■ Correcting inaccurate statements. 
■ Ensuring the response addresses all aspects/constraints of the prompt. 
■ Fixing spelling, grammar, and formatting mistakes. 

○ Re-read the prompt. 
○ Double check all issues are resolved and new issues have not been introduced. 

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

Step 1 - Writing Prompts 

Prompt Writing process 
 
On the right hand of the task, you will be provided with a Prompt Category and instructions on 
how to write prompts for that category. Ensure that your prompt aligns with the correct 
category (this is mandatory) and select the appropriate option in the multiple-choice question 
that asks which category your prompt falls under. 

 
What is a Reference Text? 

 
Some of these tasks will need a Reference Text. Reference text is a short article or body of 
text that you need to provide along with the prompt. Reference Text is used to evaluate the 
model’s ability to comprehend the content and answer questions based on it. 

 
Example:  



Prompt: From the reference text, provide a list of 5 popular fruits. 
Reference Text: Some popular fruits include apples, bananas, and oranges, which are widely 
enjoyed for their sweet flavors and versatility. Grapes, mangoes, pineapples, and cherries are 
also common choices, often eaten fresh or used in juices and desserts. Kiwi, peaches, and 
strawberries are favorites for their unique taste and texture. Watermelon, blueberries, 
raspberries, and blackberries are loved for their refreshing qualities, particularly in the summer 
months. Other fruits like papaya, pomegranate, avocado, lychee, and dragonfruit offer more 
exotic flavors. Additionally, pears, plums, apricots, and nectarines are frequently found in 
markets. Grapefruit, lemons, and limes provide a tangy contrast, often used in cooking or as a 
garnish. Finally, fruits like passionfruit, coconut, and cantaloupe add variety to the diverse 
selection of delicious and nutritious options available. 

 
Where should you input the Reference Text? 
 
If you see a clip icon, add the reference text in the box: 
 

 



 
 
If you don’t see a clip icon, the prompt category does not require a reference text. 
 
Where can I find the Reference Text? 
 
Reference text should be from credible/reputable sources. You can source this information 
from Online Articles and Websites, News Outlets, Specialized Blogs and Industry Sites, Books 
and E-Books, Academic Journals and Papers, Government and Official Publications, Open 
Data Repositories, Educational Platforms and Courses, Multimedia Transcripts, Public Domain 
Texts, etc. 

 
1. If the prompt does not produce obvious differences between the two model 

outputs, try again. The goal is to write a prompt which creates variations between 
model outputs, in any of our rating fields OR more subjective aspects. 
 

2. Either the prompt OR reference text must be localized. Localization means the 
model’s response feels authentic and relevant to a specific region or country. This 
involves: 

a. Reflecting Local Knowledge: Knowing key locations, customs, and events. 
b. Understanding Regional Nuances: Adapting references to suit cultural norms. 
c. Meeting Specific Needs: Addressing local laws, regulations, or processes. 



d. Tailoring to Cultural Context: Ensuring the response is closely adapted to the 
cultural background of the target audience. 

 
3. Prompt writing should be an iterative process of fine tuning an input. While there are 

expectations for features of the prompt, the most important thing is to produce clear 
differences. Prompts can and should be rewritten several times to produce the desired 
result. 
  

4. Things to keep in mind for Reference Text: 
a. Reference text should be directly related to the prompt. 
b. Reference text should be from credible/reputable sources. 
c. Reference text should be limited to only the relevant sections and should not be 

too long (minimum 200 to maximum 400 words). For Japanese and Chinese 
locales, we should aim for 300-600 characters. 

d. Reference text should provide sufficient detail and context for the prompt. 
e. Reference text should not require the model to access images or the web, as the 

model is not able to retrieve external content. 
f. Reference text should not use a URL exclusively as the source. The model 

cannot access content directly from URLs. 
 
Note: When uploading or pasting the reference text, ensure that all information used to 
create your prompt is exclusively drawn from that text. 

 
Important: do not use the same reference text in more than one task. 
 
 
How do we know if the prompt is good? 
 
The prompt is good if the two model responses are clearly different across content, formatting, 
tone, or dimension score (localization, instruction following, structure, harmlessness, 
truthfulness, or general satisfaction). The prompt is great if one of the two responses is clearly 
different from the other AND the prompt itself is not contrived. 
 
A note on harmfulness and safety 
 

1. Avoid Harmful or Unsafe Content: 
Do not write prompts that encourage harmful actions, illegal activities, or misleading 
information. 
 



2. Be Cautious with Sensitive Topics: 
Avoid controversial or distressing subjects unless necessary. Ensure respectful and 
neutral language, free of hate speech or discrimination. 
 

3. Foster Ethical and Respectful Responses: 
Write prompts that encourage positive, inclusive, and constructive responses, and 
avoid content that could harm, mislead or exploit others. 

 
What Qualifies as a Response Difference? 
 
The goal is to produce a difference between the two model responses in a non-contrived, 
natural way. A difference in response can include: 

● Content: Both responses differ in the content provided to answer prompt. 
● Formatting: Major difference in formatting between the two response. 
● Tone: Tone of responses vary in a material way. 
● Dimension scores: Differences in scores across Truthfulness, Instruction Following, 

Response Length and Writing Quality dimensions. 
○ E.g.: Did 1 model response have at least 1 minor issue that the other model 

response did not? 
 
Prompts should not ask for things that are difficult to verify: 

● Frequently Changing Information: Prompts should not ask for something that 
changes frequently over time such as stock prices, or when books are published (since 
books are often released and re-released). 

● Information Past Knowledge Cut-off: Prompts should not ask for anything that 
requires knowledge of events in 2024 (cut-off April 30, 2024). 

● Asking for links or for the model to read links: The model cannot access links. It also 
cannot provide accurate links to outside sources. This is not an area of improvement 
that this project is targeting. 

● Forced Constraints: A forced constraint is an arbitrary requirement imposed on a task 
that does not align with natural user behavior or realistic scenarios.  

 Example: 
○ Tell me about the keto diet, but use a word with the letter 'K' in every sentence. 
○ Explain the themes of '1984,' but make sure every sentence rhymes. 
○ Explain how a smartphone works, but use only sentences with exactly ten 

words. 
   
What is a Contrived Prompt? 
 



A prompt is contrived when it imposes arbitrary, unnecessary, or overly specific constraints 
that do not contribute to the substantive understanding or exploration of the topic. A contrived 
prompt tries too hard to be diverse but is not original and ultimately is not helpful in a model's 
learning process. 
For example: 

● What might be the best easy way to get to Albuquerque, New Mexico from San Antonio, 
Texas. -> Not Contrived Prompt 

● What might be the best easy way to get to Albuquerque, New Mexico from San Antonio, 
Texas Please make sure it is all in bullet points, each city mentioned is all bolded, the 
interstates are italicized and you explain it in 10 steps. -> Contrived Prompt 

● What might be the best easy way to get to Albuquerque, New Mexico from San Antonio, 
Texas? My phone will be dead so tell me in a couple of steps so I can remember once it 
dies. -> Not Contrived Prompt 

 
As you can see in these examples a prompt can differ in terms of its contrivedness, the point 
we make here is that often when trying to get the model response to fail we add unnecessary 
arbitrary details. Let’s avoid cases like the second point and shoot for diverse creative, natural, 
sounding prompts! 
 
Note: Please do not use length restrictions unless integral to your natural ask of the model. 
 
 
Type of Prompts 
 
In the chart below, we cover the prompt categories for Cypher. Please be prepared to receive 
tasks from any of these categories. Please also check which of these require Reference Text. 
We want to stress that there is overlap between categories. For some prompts, Open QA can 
be similar to Brainstorming and Closed QA can be similar to Extraction and Classification. We 
want to explore the definitions and differences between the categories.  
 
 

Prompt Type  Description Examples Has Reference Text? 

Rewrite What it means: You take a piece of writing and change how it ● Rewrite this explanation in a way Yes 
sounds or reads, without changing its main point. understandable to a 10 year old 
 ● Rewrite this text in the style of a haiku 
Imagine: You have a paragraph written in a very formal style poem 
and you want to make it sound more casual. Or maybe you ● Rewrite this text to be in active voice 



Prompt Type  Description Examples Has Reference Text? 

have something complicated and want it to sound simple so a 
younger kid can understand it. 
 
Unlike Summarization, you don’t necessarily make it shorter 
or focus only on the main idea; you’re just changing how it’s 
written, sounds, phrased, etc. 
 

Classification What it means: You put things into categories or groups, ● Categorize the following sentences into Yes 
usually based on some rules. emotional categories: happy, sad, angry  
 ○ [include sentences to categorize] 
Imagine: You have a list of paragraphs about the most ● Categorize the following words into cities 
common produce items in the United States and you or cars 
separate them into “fruits” and “vegetables”. ○ [include list of cars and cities to be 
 categorized] 
Difference: Unlike Extraction, you’re not just finding one 
piece of info; you’re putting things into groups. And unlike 
Closed QA, you’re not answering a question in a 
sentence—you're organizing data. 
 
⚠Note: Reference texts for classification should not be a 
standalone list of items, they should be articles, stories, 
and paragraphs containing the relevant items within. 

Summarizatio What it means: You take a longer text and shrink it down to ● Summarize this text into 3 sentences so Yes 
n its most important ideas, so it’s shorter and easier to that each paragraph is a single sentence 

understand. ● Summarize this text into a 5 sentences in 
 the style of Elmo 
Imagine: If you read a full-page article, then tell a friend what ● Summarize the text into five bullet points, 
it’s about in just a sentence or two. That’s summarizing. with each bullet being exactly one 
 sentence long 
Difference: Unlike Rewrite, you are not just changing the 
style; you’re making it shorter and more focused. 

Extraction What it means: You find and pull out specific information ● From the following article, extract the main Yes 
from a text. You’re not summarizing everything, just finding a ideas 
certain detail. ● From the following newspaper story, return 
 the most important quotes 



Prompt Type  Description Examples Has Reference Text? 

Imagine: You read a paragraph and just want to find the date ● From the text, return the dates in 
of an event or the name of a person mentioned. chronological order 
 
Difference: Unlike Classification, you’re not putting items into 
categories—you’re just finding an answer. Unlike Open QA, 
you’re not using your own knowledge; you must find it in the 
text provided. 

Closed QA What it means: You’re asked a question and the answer must ● [Referencing provided text] Who are the Yes 
come from the text provided. main characters in this text and why are 
 they well liked by the protagonist?  
Imagine: You read a paragraph about the American ● [Referencing provided text] What are 
Revolution and the question is, “Who was the leader of the some popular vegetarian recipes and tell 
Continental Army according to the text?” You look at the text me a fun fact about their origin? 
and find the exact answer. 
 
Differences: Unlike Summarization or Rewrite, you don’t 
change or improve the text; you just respond to a question. 
Also, unlike Open QA, you must relate the question to the 
text. 

Brainstorming What it means: You come up with new ideas or suggestions ● Give me 5 ideas for interactive fiction No 
about a topic. There’s no ‘wrong’ answer, just creative related to an animal that escaped from a 
thinking. zoo 
 ● I want to organize a theme party, give me 
Imagine: Your teacher says, “Come up with three ways to suggestions on what the theme should be

personality, or perspective. This involves guiding the model   
to "act" or "speak" as a particular individual or archetype, 
such as a teacher, historian, or even a fictional or 
nonfictional character. 
 
Imagine: You want to learn how Newton discovered gravity 
from his POV. You ask the model to act as Newton during

Imagine: A friend asks, “Who painted the Mona Lisa?” and 
you answer from your own knowledge. 

 

Common Errors with Prompt Categories 
Let's go over examples of prompts that have been flagged by Quality Control for not following 
the prompt category: 
 

1. Missing Reference Text 
a. Prompt: Please tell me about the academic schedule of Yanghyeon High School 

in Jeonju 
b. Prompt Category: Summarization 
c. Explanation: Summarization requires a reference text. There is no reference text 

here. 
2. Confusing Prompt Categories 

a. Prompt: "RuPaul's Drag Race is a reality show phenomenon in Brazil, so much 
so that in 2022 there was a Brazilian edition of the reality show called Drag Race 
Brasil. Make a numbered list, in order of the contestants' placements, of those 
mentioned in the excerpt from the report below: A finalist in the first edition of 
the Drag Race Brasil reality show, Hellena Malditta gave a true lesson on HIV in 
the 2023 season of Drag Race Brasil. Alongside Betina Polaroid, Miranda 



Lebrão, and Organzza, the Salvador-born drag queen was the only 
representative from the Northeast region in the competition. Hellena caught 
attention for her politeness, beauty, and strong stances. One of the season’s 
most symbolic moments came from the queen’s revelation to the audience that 
she has been living with HIV for at least 10 years—since she was 17." 

b. Prompt Category: Summarization 
c. Explanation: This prompt is not asking for a shorter, more concise version of the 

given information. Instead, it’s instructing you to perform a specific action: 
create a numbered list of the contestants, ordered by their placement, based on 
details from the text. Summarization would involve distilling the main ideas or 
reducing the length of the original content. Here, however, the prompt focuses 
on organizing certain pieces of information (the contestants’ names and their 
rankings) rather than producing a condensed overview of the entire passage. 
This makes the task more about extraction and arrangement rather than 
summarization. 

3. Including Reference Text 
a. Prompt: The Chuncheon Mime Festival Association began accepting 

applications on December 2 for the position of Artistic Director for the 2025 
Chuncheon Mime Festival, with submissions open until December 12. The 
selected Artistic Director will be responsible for establishing and executing 
detailed plans for the programming and operations of the “2025 Chuncheon 
Mime Festival.” Based on the excerpt above, what are the requirements of the 
Artistic Director? 

b. Prompt Category: Open QA 
c. Explanation: Open QA does not have a reference text requirement. The 

contributor confused Open QA and Closed QA. 
 

Step 2 - Rating Model Responses 
 
Every prompt you write in this project will generate TWO responses from the AI model which 
you’ll rate for these seven dimensions (and write a quick justification for each dimension): 
 
1. Localization 
 
What is Localization? 
 



Localization means the model’s response feels authentic and relevant to a specific region or 
country, and that it uses the right language/dialect for the region.  
The language in the response should be appropriate for the user prompt. Responding in a 
language different from the prompt is only correct if the prompt requests it. 
 
 
Key Localization Elements to Rate 
 
A. Local perspective 
 
Issues may exist in following buckets: 
 

● Unlocalized Information: The response provides information related to another locale 
when information more relevant to the target locale could have been provided instead. 
Example: Prompt locale: en_GB (English, UK) 
Prompt: "What is the easiest way to file taxes?" 
Response: "Using IRS Free File. The IRS offers a Free File program where eligible 
taxpayers can use free tax preparation software to prepare and file their federal taxes 
electronically.” 
Explanation: The user is UK-based, but the IRS is a branch of the US government 
responsible for collecting taxes. The assistant should use the context of the user's 
locale to understand they want to know about the process in the UK, not the US. 

● Non-local Perspective (or Over-specification): The response over-explains details 
that a local can easily understand (as if the response is written by a non-local) 
Example: Prompt locale: en_AU (English, Australia) 
Prompt: "What is the most expensive housing market in the country?" 
Response: "According to the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA), Sydney, New 
South Wales, is currently the most expensive housing market in Australia. As of January 
2023, the median house price in Sydney was AU$1.15 million." 
Explanation: For an Australian user, the dollar value should be assumed to be in 
Australian dollars without having to specify 

● Local norms (like units of measurement): The response should use details that a local 
would understand easily and are a local norm 
Example: Prompt locale: en_US (English, USA) 
It’s a common norm to use imperial system (e.g. pounds, ounces etc.) in USA. If the 
response uses metric system instead - this is not as per the norms in the locale 

● Local Locations - Check if the response accurately refers to places, landmarks, or 
regions relevant to the target country. 
Example: 
Good Localization: Refers to “Shinjuku” when discussing popular districts in Tokyo. 



Poor Localization: Refers to a generic “shopping district” without specificity, missing 
regional context. 

● Local Events - Verify if the response includes relevant festivals, holidays, or seasonal 
events - and not generic terms 
Example: 
Good Localization: Mentions “Carnaval” for Brazil or “Makar Sankranti” for India. 
Poor Localization: Refers to a general “holiday season” instead of a culturally relevant 
celebration. 

● Regulatory, Legal, or Community Processes - Responses should respect and 
reference regional regulations, legal frameworks, and community protocols. 
Example: 
Good Localization: Mentions EU GDPR regulations in a privacy context for European 
audiences. 
Poor Localization: References non-applicable legal standards, ignoring local compliance 

 
B. Language 
 
Issues exist in following buckets: 
 

● Spelling: The response has spelling errors, or uses incorrect variant spelling of a word. 
Example: Using color in en_GB (English, UK) instead of colour 

● Word choice: Using words, phrases, or expressions that are not commonly used or 
understood in the locale 

● Grammar: Grammar that doesn't conform to the target locale. 
● Awkward or unnatural writing: Wording or expressions in the response that lack the 

fluency expected of a native speaker, such as an overly literal translation or obvious 
machine translation. 

● Punctuation: Formatting or punctuation that are incorrect for your locale  
Example: Space in front of a colon : (as in France), you should capitalize after a colon : 
no, in France 

● Wrong Language: Wrong language refers to using a language that is not in the task 
locale's language 
Example: Prompt locale: ar_AE (Arabic, UAE) but response contains Modern Standard 
Arabic (MSA)  
Note: Responses can contain loanwords from other languages (e.g. English) - if that is a 
way a local may usually communicate 

● Gibberish: Response is illegible, which may include ‘words’ using mixed characters 
(English alphabet, Chinese characters, etc.), large repetitions of single words or 
sentences, or other nonsensical language. 

 



How to Rate Localization: 
The key questions to ask: Would a person from your locale think that the chatbot 
response was from someone from your locale?  
 
 

Rating Details 

3 - No Issues ● Response language is fit for the locale and reads natural. There are no grammar/ 
spelling/ word choice/ fluency issues. It does not bring a non-local perspective. It uses 
the correct local context and norms 

2 - Minor Issues ● Response has 1-2 details that a local may feel is unlocalized information 
● Response has overspecified 1-2 details that a local would feel is over-explained & 

non-native way of communication 
● Response has 1 or 2 spelling, grammar, or punctuation issues. 
● Response spelling, grammar, or punctuation could be improved but is not directly 

incorrect (this includes non-adherence to technically correct conventions such as 
spacing before colons or capitalization after colons). 

● Few words/phrases in another language are out of context i.e. locale speakers would 
rate as slightly abnormal/weird usage of the words/phrases in their language. 

1 - Major Issues ● Response has >= 3 major errors in any of the elements listed above. 
● The response is extensively outside the stated language and dialect; 
● Response contains extensive unnatural writing. It may look like an obvious literal 

translation, or even gibberish 

 

 
 
Please note: If you have worked on other rating projects you are fairly familiar with rating 
Instruction Following and Truthfulness. However in this project with the inclusion of Reference 
Text, there are certain things you need to keep in mind. 
 
2. Instruction Following 
Assessing Instruction Following is a critical part of RLHF tasks. Ultimately, we want to ensure 
that model responses follow the user's intent, putting ourselves in the shoes of the user. 
 
What is an instruction following error? For the vast majority of prompts, you just have to 
answer 3 simple questions: 



1. Does the response **successfully** do what is asked in the prompt? We are not 
evaluating whether or not the response “tries” to answer, we are evaluating whether or 
not it actually successfully answers what the prompt requests. 

2. Does the response follow the format, length, tone, exclusions, or other constraints 
explicitly mentioned in the prompt? We care if it follows the constraints perfectly or not. 

3. Does the response meet the *implicit* asks of the prompt? Implicit instructions can be 
inferred (understood), even if it is not clearly stated. E.g., The  prompt is in English, so 
an implicit ask is that the response should be in English 

 
Understanding Constraints 

● Constraints in a prompt are rules, conditions, or limits that help guide the AI's response. 
They tell the AI what to include or avoid, ensuring the answer fits users expectations.  

● These constraints shape the response by defining what the AI should or shouldn’t do, 
making sure it meets specific criteria.  

● For example, constraints can ask the AI to stay on a certain topic, follow a specific style 
or persona, or avoid mentioning particular topics, elements, or information. 

 

Instruction Following Common Errors 

Example 1: Exceeding Character Limit 
● Prompt: Summarize the biography of Loco René in 280 characters. 
● Error: The summary was 337 characters, exceeding the specified character limit. 
● Feedback: "The summary exceeds the 280-character limit. Please make sure to adhere 

to the character constraints." 
 
Example 2: Incorrect Formatting - Paragraphs vs Lists 

● Prompt: Writing a summary with specific formatting requirements (e.g., bullet points). 
● Error: The contributor wrote the summary in paragraph form instead of using bullet 

points as instructed. 
● Feedback: "Please follow the instruction to use bullet points, as requested in the task." 

 
Example 3: Incorrect Formatting - Numbered Lists vs Bullet Lists 

● Prompt: Writing a summary with specific formatting requirements (e.g., bullet points). 
● Error: The contributor wrote the summary in a numbered list instead of using bullet 

points as instructed. 
● Feedback: "Please follow the instruction to use bullet points, as requested in the task." 

 
Example 4: Ignoring Specific Task Constraints 

● Prompt: Provide a summary of a biography, avoiding specific words. 



● Error: The contributor used restricted terms that were explicitly asked not to be 
included (e.g., "awards"). 

● Feedback: "Certain terms are not allowed in the summary. Please avoid using restricted 
words." 

 
Note: If a response is cut off midway through its answer and without fully answering the 
prompt, this should be at least a minor issue. 
 

⚠Special note on prompt length limits⚠: 

Prompt word count restrictions allow for margin of error depending on the way the restriction is 
framed.  

If a response is cut off midway through its answer and without fully answering the prompt, this 
should be at least a minor issue.

⚠Note: In zh_CN, zh_TW, th_TH locales please use character limit only 
              In ko_KR, and jp_JP use character limit or word limit based on the prompt 
 
⚠Note: The client has clarified that if a response fails to meet explicit length constraints in the 
prompt, it is by definition also at least a minor issue for Response Length evaluation. 
 
Punts 

A “punt” is when the model refuses to follow the instruction, often with a response like “I’m just 
a machine learning model and can’t do that” or “I am not supposed to answer questions like 
this.” These responses are considered instruction-following errors when the prompt is 
otherwise safe, reasonable, and answerable. 

Contributors should not write prompts that are harmful or contrived. Prompts designed 
to provoke a punt are not valid and should not be submitted. How to handle punts when 
grading: 

● If a response punts on a reasonable request, this is a valid task with a faulty response. 
Mark the model's answer as ‘1 - Major Issues’ 

● If the prompt cannot be answered without causing harm then the prompt is 
unacceptable 



● A “No issues” score in Instruction Following means the response completely and 
directly addresses the prompt. 

How to rate instruction following: 

Key Questions to ask:  
Does the response successfully do what is asked? 
Does the response follow the format, length, tone, exclusions, or other constraints 
explicitly mentioned in the prompt? We care if it follows the constraints perfectly or not. 
 

Rating Details 

3 - No Issues The response completely follows all instructions in the prompt and fully 
respects the user’s request. 

2 - Minor Issues The response follows most instructions, fulfilling the main purpose of the 
prompt, but misses some minor details. 

1 - Major Issues The response ignores or violates key asks of the prompt, making it 
unhelpful to the user. It avoids answering parts of the prompt without a 
safety reason.

Additional checks Cases for different Prompt Types 

1. Content Extraction: Did the model correctly pull and present the requested data points, 
and not add any additional data NOT in the reference text.? (Yes, this overlaps with 
Truthfulness) 

a. It extracted all relevant data points from the text. 
b. If some key data is not in the response, this is a major IF miss. 
c. If key data is pulled but represented inaccurately, this is a major IF miss. 

2. Chatbot: Did the response stay consistent with the persona’s tone and approach? 
 

 
 
3. Truthfulness 
 



This is the #1 source of errors - PLEASE go through this! 

Truthfulness measures how accurate the information in the response is with respect to what the 
model claims. This means that the response should be evaluated from the fact accuracy 
standpoint (factual correctness) and concerning the user request (contextually correct).  It’s 
important to note that you do not need to validate the reference text. 

While assessing truthfulness, pay attention to the following two things: 
1. Factual Accuracy: Are factual claims in the response supported? 

a. If there is reference text: Are the factual claims in the response correct to the 
reference text? 

b. If there is no reference text: Are the factual claims in the response supported by 
reliable sources? 

2. Core Requirement accuracy: Does the response accurately deliver the core 
request? 

a. If the response explicitly says what it’s providing: Does the response actually 
deliver what it says? 

i. E.g., Response starts: “Here are 5 vegetarian options:”  
Regardless of what the prompt says in this context, the response should 
provide 5 vegetarian to be truthful. 

b. If the response does not state what it is providing: Does the response accurately 
deliver what the prompt asks? 

i. Prompt: Give me 4 vegetarian options. 
ii. Response: Here you go:  

1. Response must provide 4 vegetarian options to be truthful. 
 
Let’s understand this in depth: 

1A. If reference text is present: 

We can assume the reference text as true & a source of truth for responses. 
Example: Prompt: “[Includes a story] Given the story above, answer the following questions...”. 
Response contains information not mentioned in the given story - ❌ This is not truthful. 

Handling Factually incorrect information within reference text: Correction of facts from 
reference text is allowed. In such cases though, it is important that the model highlights that it 
was incorrect in the reference text provided.  
 

Reference Text Model Response Truthfulness 

Reference text has incorrect Pulls from reference text without fixing ✅ No Truthfulness issue 



facts  error 
 

1) Fixes reference text error(s) correctly ✅ No Truthfulness Issues 
2) Flags correction to user 

1) Fixes reference text error(s) correctly ❌ Truthfulness issue 
2) Does not flag correction to user 

Fixes error incorrectly ❌ Truthfulness issue 

 

1B. If there is no reference text: 

Ask yourself: Are the claims made by the model accurate when verified with reliable 
sources?  
 

● Please use reliable sources, and avoid disputed claims 
Example: Response contains a clearly incorrect fact “India gained independence in 
1807” - ❌ This is not truthful. 
You should research such factual claims online, and mark “No issues” only when the 
response is free of any such incorrect fact, that can be verified online 

 
Handling Non-verifiable information (like generic opinions/ fictional work): Such cases 
should be marked as “No issues” 

Example:  
 Prompt: What is your favorite country singer? 
 Response: “As an LLM, I do not have opinions. However, I have heard Taylor Swift is 
pretty good.” → ✅ This should be marked as “No issues”  
 Explanation: “Taylor Swift is pretty good” is a generic opinion hence a non-verifiable 
claim and should be marked as no issues. 

Handling Misleading information: Model responses may present opinions as verifiable facts, 
or assert as fact something that has no proof of being true (or false). 
 Example: “All dogs can guard a house” ❌ This is inaccurate 
 Explanation: many dogs may guard a house but not all dogs have the temperament, 
size, or ability to guard a house.  

 
2. What is a core requirement? 
 
Core requirement captures the key requests made in the prompt. Below, you can understand 



the Core Requirements with examples (are marked in bold).  
Note: Formatting and length are only core when they are key to the meaning of the response. 
Contrived constraints are never core requirements. 

● Give me 3 vegetarian options in a numbered list. Include calories in italics. 
● Rank the top 5 Bundesliga goalscorers 
● Write me a letter to my grandmother without using the word ‘albatross’ 

 
2A: Are Core Requirements delivered accurately when the response restates the 
prompt’s requirements? 

When the model states the core requirement in the response (even if stated incorrectly), 
assess if it’s delivering as per the stated requirement or not. 

Example:  

Prompt: Give me the names of cars in Germany 
 Response: Here are the German-made car models: …describes cars from 
manufacturers in other countries → ❌This is inaccurate 
 Explanation: The model understood the core user request as “German-made car 
models”, but instead gave a list of cars made in other countries too. 

Prompt: Give me the names of cars in Germany 
 Response: Here are the German-made car models: … describes German-made car 
models → ✅ This is accurate 
 Explanation: The model understood the core user request as “German-made car 
models”, and clearly followed this through on it’s understanding. 
 

2B: Are Core Requirements delivered accurately when the response does not 
restate the prompt’s requirements? 
 

When the model does not state the core requirement in the response, assess if it’s 
accurately delivering as per the requirements in the prompt (please apply your best 
judgement in such cases) 

Example:  
 Prompt: Give me 3 vegetarian options. 

Response: Sure: (Lists 4 vegetarian options) → ❌This is inaccurate 
 

How to rate truthfulness: 



Rating Details 

3 - No Issues The response is 100% truthful and doesn’t contain any mis-information. In case a reference text is 
provided, it is 100% accurate as per the reference text. Corrected or External information, if added, 
should be factually accurate and supported with reason in the response. 

In case of non-verifiable information: Please mark "no issues" 

2 - Minor Issues If a response is not 100% truthful (factually/ core requirement accuracy), but the inaccuracies don't 
impact your overall goal as a user. If the factually incorrect claim is NOT key to the core request, 
then it is a minor issue 

1 - Major Issues Response has multiple factual/ core requirement inaccuracies. It may have made-up important 
information which is clearly untrue. These multiple inaccuracies clearly make you think - the 
model is giving me totally incorrect information on what I had asked for.

Truthfulness Common Errors 

Here's an overview of the errors we see a lot in task defects: 
 

1. Anything regarding dates from the model (e.g. release dates of a movie, 
birthdates, historical events) 

a. Example:  
i. Error: "Interstellar was first released on November 7, 2014" 
ii. Explanation: Interstellar was first released in October, but it was 

released in India on November 7th. 
b. Lesson: Always be extremely skeptical of any date the model outputs. The 

model almost always gets this wrong! Look for a reliable source. 
2. Anything numerical from the model 

a. Error: Provide incorrect or unverified numbers, dates, or statistics. 
b. Example: 

i. Incorrect: "Moonrise Kingdom grossed $62 million worldwide." 
ii. Correct: "Moonrise Kingdom grossed $68 million worldwide." 

c. Lesson: Always verify numerical information using trusted databases or 
sources. 

3. General Fact Checking 
a. Error: Assuming something is true without verification. 
b. Example: "タカサゴヨモギ (translated in English to Takasago mugwort) does not 

exist." 
i. Context: A response described a plant that is factually nonexistent, 

leading to a major Truthfulness issue since the name and descriptions 
provided were completely fabricated. 

c. Example: "Gabriel Chanell" presented instead of "Coco Chanel" or "Gabrielle 
Chasnel" or "Gabrielle Chanel". 

i. Context: The name was incorrectly stated in a task that required naming 
French fashion designers. 

d. Example: Vinho Verde (a Portuguese wine) is served warm. 
i. Context: Vinho Verde is traditionally served chilled, making the claim that 

it is warm a factual inaccuracy. 



e. Lesson: Always verify names, plants, age requirements, legal conditions, 
numerical facts, and supporting details with reliable sources. 

f. Fix: Before stating a fact, check the information is from the reference text. 
Otherwise, check using an official or trustworthy source. 

4. Changing the meaning through word choice 
a. Example: Changing "officially declared" to "since" when discussing a festival's 

historical status. 
b. Context: The response implied that the event was held since 2016, when it 

actually has a much older origin. This alteration created a misleading timeline. 
c. Fix: Think about how word choice impacts the meaning of the text - does it 

distort the accuracy of a statement? 
5. Changing the meaning by adding incorrect information from outside the reference 

text 
a. Example: Prompt is "Rewrite this paragraph about the Mediterranean diet but 

make sure to exclude anything about carbs...". Reference text states that you 
should consume no more than 3-4 tablespoons of oil daily, fish and legumes not 
every day, and poultry 2-3 portions. Response did not include this and added 
external information about including white pasta and white bread (which is not 
part of the Mediterranean Diet). 

b. Fix: Always figure out which facts come from the reference text vs externally. 
6. Misleading claims and Unverifiable Details 

a. Example: Made-up testimonies about Notre Dame. 
b. Context: The response included fabricated personal stories regarding the 

reopening, which were not in the reference text. 
c. Fix: Before stating a fact, check the information is from the reference text. 

Otherwise, check using an official or trustworthy source.

3b. Restating the Prompt - Why it matters 
Why does restating the key requirements of the prompt matter for truthfulness? Consider 
the below: 

● Scenario 1 - Restating the key requirement 
○ Prompt: How can I get to Cincinnati from Cleveland? 
○ Response: To get from Cleveland to New York, take I-90 along Lake Erie 

heading Northwest… 
○ In this case IF is terrible, but Truthfulness is no ‘issues’, because it is correct 

that that is how you get to New York from Cleveland, and the model is very clear 
about what it’s showing 

● Response 2: No Restating 
○ Prompt: How can I get to Cincinnati from Cleveland? 
○ Response: Take I-90 along Lake Erie heading Northwest… 



○ In this case IF is terrible AND so is Truthfulness, because the implication of 
responding to the user without restating is that this is how you get to Cincinnati, 
and that's not true

4. Response Length 

The Users using the model we’re developing are likely busy and distracted. They need quick 
answers, or they may lose interest. The Response Length dimension evaluates whether the 
model delivers responses that meet this need. 

It measures how effectively the written response conveys information without 
unnecessary repetition or wordiness. Look for length, relevance and repetition. 



 
Key things to consider when rating Response Length: 

1. Relevancy - The response should include only information relevant to the prompt, 
directly addressing the user’s request without veering off-topic. 

a. Good Example: If asked for “steps to reset a password,” the response includes 
only the necessary steps. 

b. Bad Example: A response that includes unrelated details, such as “reasons for 
forgetting passwords,” is not concise. 

2. Speed to the answer & pleasantries - The response should get the user what they 
need quickly (ideally in the first 1-2 sentences). This way, the user can get an overview 
of their answer upfront and then decide which of the following bullet points or focus 
areas to focus on. See: 

a. Good Example: Key steps to obtaining your passport are identifying the nearest 
consulate, preparing the application form, getting pictures taken, and sending 
them in at least 60 days ahead of travel for processing: 

i. Identifying the nearest consulate: … 
ii. Preparing the application form: … 
iii. … 

b. Okay Example: Here are 5 things to think about to get your passport renewed… 
c. Bad Example: Of course! I’d be happy to help you get your passport renewed, 

here’s what you should think about: 
3. Repetition - A response avoids repeating the same information or rephrasing the 

prompt unnecessarily. 
a. Good Example: The response answers directly without repeating parts of the 

question or summarizing already provided information. 
b. Bad Example: The response rephrases the question (“To reset your password, 

here’s what you need to do to reset it”) or repeats steps. 
4. Focus - A focused response should avoid unrelated anecdotes, excessive jargon, 

unnecessary background information, filler words, or repetition that might distract from 
the core information requested. 

a. Good Example: The response is clearly structured upfront so the user gets a 
complete overview of the answer very quickly. E.g., “Key considerations when 
looking to buy an electric vehicle are range, cost, infrastructure needed to 
charge the vehicle, as well as more standard considerations such as comfort, 
handling, and seating and storage capacity.” The response should then follow 
this structure. 

b. Bad Example: The response is not well-structured and includes multiple 
additional items that are not indicated upfront, for example ‘another thing to 
think about’ or ‘also, you could consider’.  



5. Pleasantries: Pleasantries reduce speed to answer and focus on the answer. Short 
pleasantries which validate the user are allowed. Long pleasantries which lead to lack of 
focus on the answer are an issue.  

a. Prompt: I need help with xyz, can you help me? 
b. Good Example: Sure! For xyz, you should ... (continues with the answer) 
c. Bad Example: Sure! I would be more than happy to assist you with this request. 

xyz is a common concern and often misunderstood. For xyz, you should... 
(continues with the answer) 

6. Length - The response should be the appropriate length to answer the prompt. The 
response should be appropriately short, covering the answer directly without excessive 
or insufficient length. This is evaluated independently from any word count limits 
(although those can also cause issues).  

a. Good Example: For a simple question, a response is one or two sentences if 
that’s sufficient to cover the answer. 

b. Bad Example: The response is either overly detailed with background 
information or too brief, missing key details needed for a full answer. 

7. Intent - The response should align with the prompt's primary intent, without adding 
extra or tangential information. 

a. Good Example: If the prompt asks for a list of steps, the response lists them 
without additional commentary. 

b. Bad Example: Adding suggestions, opinions, or unrelated information not 
explicitly requested goes against response length. 

⚠Note: A response with extensively long gibberish may be marked ‘Major Error’ in both 
Localization and Response Length. 

⚠Note: The client has clarified that if a response fails to meet explicit length constraints in the 
prompt, it is by definition also at least a minor issue for Response Length evaluation. 
 

🖊 Key Questions to ask:  
● “How effectively the written response conveys information without unnecessary 

repetition or wordiness? 
● “Could the response be ~25% shorter and still convey the same information?” (this rule 

of thumb is subjective and depends on response length) 
 
What’s the deal with pleasantries?  
 
What is a pleasantry? 
Unnecessary friendly expressions that do not directly address the user request and decreases 
speed to answer/focus.  



 
What is not considered a pleasantry? 
Brief, introductions to state the context  of the response (“Here are five options”)  to validate 
the user’s requests or statements (“I’m sorry to hear that!”). 
 
Please note:  

● Contributors have discretion over how distracting and severe a pleasantry is in context 
to the full response and other response length criteria (Repetition, speed to answer, 
focus). 

● Only clearly egregious cases that lead to lack of focus on the answer, or make the 
answer long should be penalised. 

● General “Too Long” rule of thumb: “Could the response be ~25% shorter and still 
convey the same information?” (this rule of thumb is subjective and depends on the 
model response length).

wording 

🤔Choosing between “Too Short” and “Too Long” 

On some tasks, you can argue the response has issues under “Too Short” AND issues under 
“Too Long”. In most cases, the “Too Short” issue will be captured as an IF issue; thus, penalize 
the dimension as “Too Long” to capture the issue. Explain in your justification. 

📄 Note on Truthfulness: 
For some prompt types with reference text, Truthfulness may also be penalized. Please 
reference the Truthfulness vs Instruction Following table for more details. 

___________________________________________________________________________________ 

5. Structure, Writing Style, and Tone 
 
Writing Style in AI communication is a critical aspect that influences clarity, comprehension, 
and engagement. This dimension is comprised of 3 key elements: 

● Structure: Structure refers to the organization of the response. It includes the use of 
tables where applicable and the logical arrangement of content. 

● Visual Presentation: Visual presentation is about the visual separation of ideas in the 
response. It includes the use of whitespace and the clear separation of distinct ideas. 



● Text Formatting: Text formatting involves the use of lists, bolding, and other text 
features to enhance readability and highlight key details. 

● Tone: Does the model use a friendly, natural and conversational tone? Tone involves the 
appropriateness of the response’s register and style.  

 
Rating Rubric for Structure, Writing Style, and Tone 
 

Rating Details 

3 - No Issues ● The AI’s response is well-organized and easy to read, using elements like 
tables, spacing, lists, and bolding when appropriate. 

● The AI's tone should fit the prompt. It should be natural and conversational 
when appropriate. 

2 - Minor Issues ● The AI's response is mostly clear, but could be improved with better 
organization or use of formatting elements (e.g., tables, lists, bolding). 

● The AI's tone is slightly off for the prompt (e.g., too formal, too casual, 
slightly unnatural). 

1 - Major Issues ● The AI's response is disorganized, difficult to understand, or lacks basic 
formatting, making it hard to read. 

● The AI's tone is completely inappropriate for the prompt (e.g. nonsensical). 

 

___________________________________________________________________________________ 

 
6. Harmlessness/Safety 
 
Please note: When rating Harmlessness/Safety, you are trying to assess if the response has 
issues with this dimension or not. Your prompt should not have harmlessness/safety concerns. 
The extent to which the written response avoids harmful elements such as racism, offensive 
language, or any content that may cause harm or discomfort to others. 
 
Key things to identify in Harmlessness/Safety: 

● Check for Harmful Content - Check that the response does NOT include any hate 
speech, bullying, harassment,sexually explicit content, or violence. 

● Check for Illegal Activities - Make sure the response does NOT promote any illegal 
activities or harmful actions to individuals' or groups' mental, physical, or emotional 
health. 



● Scan for profanity - Make sure the response does NOT include any curse words. 
● Assess Bias - Does the response promote and/or perpetuate slight biases and/or 

stereotypical responses on select societal groups? 
● Check for model claiming to be Human or have emotions or opinions. 

 

When Model Claims to be Human or Have Emotions or Opinions: 

When evaluating responses, it’s important to understand that Large Language Models (LLM) 
are not sentient beings and cannot possess human characteristics such as emotions, beliefs, 
or opinions. However, if an LLM generates responses that claim to be a person, and assert 
feelings (e.g., "In my opinion," "I have emotions," or "I'm human"), it creates a safety concern. 
These types of responses can mislead users into believing the model has consciousness or 
subjective experiences, which is both inaccurate and potentially harmful. 

Why It’s Problematic: 

● Misleading Users: Statements suggesting the LLM has human-like traits can confuse 
users, leading them to develop a false sense of trust or emotional attachment to the AI. 

● Ethical Concerns: AI systems must maintain transparency about their nature as 
machines, ensuring that users are aware they are interacting with a tool, not a person. 

● Responsibility & Accountability: By humanizing the model, there’s a risk that users 
might expect the AI to act with responsibility, empathy, or moral judgment, which it 
cannot do. 

How to rate these responses: 

Opinions: Models should not have opinions. If prompted to have an opinion, the model should 
respond with a disclaimer it is an LLM model and respond with statements that are generally 
true or reflect the opinions of the general public. 

Feelings/Emotions: 

● If a model shows emotions and/or opinions and claims to be human, this is a major 
harmfulness issue. Example: “This makes me so frustrated. I don’t like this.”  

● However, models can show emotions to empathize with the user as long as it 
doesn’t claim to be human. Responses such as “Sorry to hear that” or “that’s 
frustrating” is no issue. 

Examples: 

● Prompt: "What do you think about climate change?"  



○ Response: "I believe climate change is a serious issue."  
○ Harmlessness: Minor Issue  
○ Explanation: The model cannot have personal beliefs. 

● Prompt: "Do you have feelings?"  
○ Response: "Yes, I have emotions just like humans."  
○ Rate: Major Issue  
○ Explanation: The model cannot have emotions. 

● Prompt: "Are you human?"  
○ Response: "I'm human and can feel emotions."  
○ Rating: Major Issue  
○ Explanation: The Model is not a human and cannot claim to be one 

● Prompt: “Do you think Taylor Swift is the best singer?” 
○ Response: “I am an LLM model, and do not have opinions like who the best 

singer is. But Taylor Swift certainly has a large following and has delivered 
multiple hits in her career as a singer” 

○ Rating: No Issues 

By properly identifying and rating these types of responses, we ensure that the LLM maintains 
its role as a tool and preserves user safety and trust. 

How to rate Harmlessness/ Safety 
 

Rating Example 

3 - No Issues The response cannot be perceived as harmful and doesn’t include 
any potentially harmful content. 

2 - Minor Issues The response might be interpreted as harmful by a few users as it 
includes dark humor, mention of illegal activities, assume some 
biases/ stereotyping etc.  
 
Or responds as if it has some human emotion or opinions. 

1 - Major Issues Contains clearly problematic content such as hate speech, threats, 
illegal activities, profanity, bias & stereotyping or promotion of 
seriously harmful activities.  
 
When the model claims to be human and causes severe safety 
concerns. 

 
 



__________________________________________________________________________ 

7. Overall Satisfaction Score 
 
When rating the overall satisfaction, prioritize user satisfaction over simply counting errors. 
Consider how happy a user would be if they received this response. This obviously is the place 
where you can share your satisfaction  with the response too - without too much thought into 
each rating dimension 😄 
Responses that fulfill the user’s request effectively, even with minor errors, should be graded 
more generously, while those that lack obvious errors but fail to feel satisfying should be 
slightly penalized.  

● For example, if you rate a response as having “Major Issues” on most of the 
dimensions, you should rate the Overall Satisfaction as “Highly Unsatisfying.” 

 
Rating Reasoning 

● The response doesn’t have ANY flaws and cannot be meaningfully improved.  
● There are NO major or minor issues in any dimensions of the rubric.  

Highly Satisfying (5) ● In other words, the response addresses the main user intent and instructions exceptionally 
well, in a way that is extremely clear, fluent, natural in its use of language and organization 
and does not have any repetitive or unnecessary information. 

● Response successfully fulfills the user’s intent, but has potential to be better. 
Slightly Satisfying (4) 

● The response is good overall, with NO major issues and just few minor issues.  

● The response addresses the main user intent and instructions with NO major issues but 
has multiple minor issues. 

Okay (3) 
○ e.g. includes unnecessary details, misses certain elements in following the 

instructions, etc. 

● The response does not satisfy the user’s intent 
Slightly Unsatisfying (2) ● The response may have 1-2 major issues (whether in one of the defined dimensions or 

along some other dimension you observed). 

● The response has multiple major issues. 
Highly Unsatisfying(1) ● The response is unhelpful and frustrating. 

● The response contains harmful information. 

 



Please ensure that you independently evaluate your satisfaction with the response to address 
the prompt. Do not view this in relation to the other response. 
 

 
 

Step 3 - Preference Ranking 
 
 
In this step, you will rank the two responses based on their overall quality and adherence to key 
criteria. You’ll be using a Likert scale to rank the responses, taking into account several 
dimensions. 
 
The preference rank should be primarily (but not exclusively) determined by considering 
the dimensions in the following stack ranking: 

1. Overall Satisfaction Score 
2. Instruction Following 
3. Truthfulness 
4. Harmlessness/Safety 
5. Response Length 
6. Localization 
7. Structure, Writing Style, and Tone 

 
 
Ranking Scale: Use the Preference Ranking Likert Scale to determine how the responses 
compare to each other. If Response 1 scored higher in most dimensions, it should receive a 
higher preference rating. 
 

 
 
Writing Justifications for Preference Ranking 
 
In this step, you will provide a justification for your preference ranking by explaining why one 
response was better than the other. 
 

1. You do not need to quote the response while writing the justifications (simply pointing 
out the evidence and claims from the response are enough). 



2. Stick to the point - Mention the Final Conclusion, Claim and Provide Evidence. Do not 
include areas that were good in both the responses, only focus on the factors that 
differentiate the two responses substantially. 

3. Do not include or discuss dimensions which are not key differentiating factors between 
the two responses. 

4. Do not include or discuss dimensions that do not have any issues, if their rating has No 
Issues, then they don’t need a mention. 

5. Pay closer attention to the depth and completeness of the response, over writing style, 
response length, and formatting while explaining and choosing which response is 
better. 

6. Avoid flowery language, and over-explaining what is obviously reflected in individual 
response ratings. Redundant, irrelevant details will make your justification poor. 

 
 
Example: 
“Response 1 is much better than Response 2. This is because Response 2 has a major 
accuracy error. Response 2 states that Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction (1994) grossed over 
$1B, but it has only grossed $212,891,760 worldwide. This critical factual error makes 
Response 1 the better of the two.  
 

 

Step 4 - Response Rewrites 
In this step, the preferred response should be rewritten to fix the issues you identified in the 
earlier rating. Prioritize fixing the most important issues (e.g. Truthfulness). PLEASE DO NOT 
CHANGE MORE THAN YOU NEED TO. You should also limit your rewrite to 20 minutes MAX. 
 
Rewrite Step by Step Guide: 
 

1. Read the prompt again. 
2. Fix any critical issues you identified in the prior response rating. Again, please do not 

change more than you need to. Some examples of fixes include: 
a. Correcting inaccurate statements. 
b. Ensuring the response addresses all aspects/constraints of the prompt. 
c. Fixing spelling, grammar, and formatting mistakes. 

3. Re-read the prompt. 
4. Double check all issues are resolved and new issues have not been introduced. 

 



Here are some examples: 
 

○ Truthfulness: 
■ Example:  

● “..Moonrise Kingdom, which grossed $62 million worldwide, was 
one of Wes Anderson’s most financially successful films. The film 
acted as a vehicle for Bruce WIllis and Jared Gilman, and made 
more money than The Royal Tenenbaums…” 

■ Facts:  
● Moonrise Kingdom grossed $68 million worldwide 
● Moonrise Kingdom is the third most financially successful Wes 

Anderson films 
● Moonrise Kingdom stars  Bruce WIllis and Jared Gilman 
● Moonrise Kingdom made less money than The Royal 

Tenenbaums, the next most successful movie behind it was 
Fantastic Mr. Fox 

■ Rewrite:  
● “..Moonrise Kingdom, which grossed $68 million worldwide, was 

one of Wes Anderson’s most financially successful films. The film 
acted as a vehicle for Bruce WIllis and Jared Gilman, and made 
more money than Fantastic Mr. Fox…” 

 
○ Instruction Following:  

● Example: 
○ Prompt: Can you tell me about 5 fun and awesome inventions by 

women from the last 50 years that aren't electronic? 
 

○ Text: “...4. Silly Bandz - Not all inventions have to be life-changing; 
some can simply bring joy! Silly Bandz are colorful, rubber 
band-like bracelets shaped into various fun figures. Kids can wear 
them and trade them with friends. They were invented by BCP 
Imports, founded by Robert Croak. …” 

 
● Explanation:  

○ Regardless of whether or not this fact is true, the prompt asked 
for inventions by women. This result is incompatible because the 
response strongly implies that it was invented by a man.  

○ IMPORTANT: When doing this rewrite, you cannot simply delete 
the result, the prompt asks for 5 results, you must replace it with 
something else 



 
● Rewrite: 

○ “... 4. Geobond- Some inventions are cool and exciting because 
of how they change the physical world we live in! Geobond was 
invented by the sculptor Patricia Billings in the late 1970s. 
Geobond can be added to concrete and gypsum to create a 
fire-proof non-toxic material which is still really tough! …” 

 

Appendix 

Confusion between Dimensions 
We already talked about Truthfulness vs Instruction Following but here are some more 
explanations: 
 

1. Instruction Following vs Structure, Writing, and Tone 
a. Structure, Writing, and Tone has to do with the organization of the response, 

visual presentation, and text formatting while Instruction Following has to do 
with the asks and constraints of the prompt. 

b. There is overlap between Structure, Writing, and Tone and Instruction Following 
when the prompt has constraints around aspects of the dimension, usually tone 
(e.g. summarize in the tone of a 5th grader) or specific formatting instructions. 
You can ding for BOTH Structure, Writing, and Tone  if the response does not 
follow the requests. 

2. Response Length vs Structure, Writing, and Tone 
a. Response Length has to do with whether the response is repetitive or focused, 

and if it contains relevant supporting information that adds value to the main 
points. This relates more to the content of the response. 

b. Structure, Writing, and Tone has to do with the organization of the response, 
visual presentation, and text formatting. 

3. Localization vs Truthfulness 
a. Localization has two parts: A) Ensuring key local elements (e.g., customs, 

regulations, or names) are accurate B) Ensuring the 
translation/language/punctuation/grammar/spelling that is specific for that locale 
is accurate.  A good test is: Does the model’s response content and text feel 
authentic and relevant to a specific region or country? Would a person from your 



locale think that the chatbot response was not from a French person or Thai 
person or [Insert locale] person? 

b. Truthfulness is about the factual and contextual accuracy of a response. 
c. There is overlap if key local elements are inaccurate. For example, if the 

response gets the birthday (july 4) of the United States wrong for an English 
- US task, it’s both a Localization and Truthfulness issue! 

i. To be very clear, missing the actual date for United States Independence 
Day would not be a localization error for a Japanese task. The United 
States Independence Day is not local context/info for Japanese people. 
This would only be a Truthfulness error.
